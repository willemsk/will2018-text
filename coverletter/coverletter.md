Over the past two decades, nanopores delivered on their promise as powerful and versatile single-molecule
sensing tools, with applications ranging from portable third-generation DNA sequencing [**REF**] to direct
quantitative biomarker detection from blood [**REF**] to a potential protein sequencing method [**REF**].
Despite this enormous success story, however, a universal and accurate approach to quantify the basic physical
mechanisms governing nanopore-sensing, and in particular for biological nanopores, is currently not available.

In this work, we have developed a novel simulation framework, coined extended Poisson-Nernst-Planck and
Navier-Stokes (ePNP-NS), which is capable of modeling the nanofluidic properties of large biological nanopores
with **quantitative accuracy**, over a wide range of experimentally relevant ionic strengths and bias
voltages. We believe such a unified framework, which can be used to both interpret and guide nanopore
experiments, is currently missing from the toolbox of researchers. As such, our manuscript will be of
considerable interest not only to the nanopore community but to all researchers involved with understanding
and quantifying nanoscale transport processes.

In the first part of our manuscript, we describe the improvements of the ePNP-NS framework over the classical
equations that enable accurate modeling at the nanoscale. These include (1) the properties of the electrolyte,
formulated as self-consistent interactions between the ions, the water molecules and the pore walls; and (2)
a computationally efficient description of the nanopore's geometry and fixed charge distribution. To our
knowledge, this is the first time such an extensive combination of corrections have been applied within a
single body of work. While powerful, our modifications do not considerably increase the computational
complexity of the system, greatly enhancing the rate at which it can be adopted by the scientific community.

The majority of the paper is devoted to the application of our ePNP-NS framework on the biological nanopore
Cytolysin A (ClyA). The large interior of ClyA makes it ideal for protein sensing, and it has been used
extensively in this capacity within Dr. Maglia's research group (>15 unique papers with >500 citations in
total). Because it is a relatively 'new' pore (compared to alpha-hemolysin), computational studies that
describe the properties are currently lacking. Hence, in this work, we aim to give the readers a comprehensive
overview of the ion and water transport properties of ClyA for a wide range of ionic strengths (5 mM to
5 M NaCl) and bias voltages (-200 and + 200 mV). We validated our results using experimental new data, which
shows that our model can accurately capture the ionic conductance of ClyA for all the investigated
conditions. Encouraged by this accuracy, we are confident to state that the ePNP-NS equations realistically
describe the conditions inside, and the properties of, the pore, including the ion selectivity, the ionic
concentrations, the electrostatic potential and, the electro-osmotic flow. We expect these results to be of
great value to anyone working with ClyA and may provide insights for other nanopores as well.

We recently employed our framework on a new biological nanopore, Pleurotolysin AB (PlyAB), enabling us to
quantify the differences in electro-osmotic flow between charge mutants of the same nanopore. The work with
PlyAB is currently under a second round of revision at Nanoletters.

In conclusion, our work comprehensively describes a novel method to accurately, yet efficiently, model the
transport processes in nanoscopic systems such as biological nanopores. Therefore, we are confident that this
manuscript will be of significant interest to the interdisciplinary readership of ACS Nano.

Yours sincerely,
