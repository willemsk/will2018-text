\textbf{Concentration and positional dependent electrolyte properties.}
(a)
Dependency of the ion self-diffusion coefficients (top, \ce{Na+}: \graphline{solid}{graphblue} and \ce{Cl-}: 
\graphline{solid}{graphred}) and the ion electrophoretic mobilities (bottom, \ce{Na+}: 
\graphline{dashed}{graphblue} and \ce{Cl-}: \graphline{dashed}{graphred}) on the bulk \ce{NaCl} 
concentration. Lines represent empirical fits to experimental literature data (markers). The number next to 
the left and right axes correspond to the values at infinite dilution ($0$~M) and saturation ($\approx5$~M), 
respectively.
(b)
Dependency of electrolyte density (top, \graphline{solid}{graphpurple}), viscosity (middle, 
\graphline{dashed}{graphpurple}) and relative permittivity (bottom, \graphline{dotted}{graphpurple}) on the 
bulk \ce{NaCl} concentration. Lines represent empirical fits to experimental literature data (markers).
(c)
Dependency of the relative ion diffusion coefficient and the mobility (top, \graphline{solid}{graphgreen}) 
and the relative viscosity (bottom, \graphline{dashed}{graphgreen}) on the distance from the nanopore wall. 
The relative diffusion coefficient (and its mobility) declines sharply when an ion approaches within 
$\approx1.0$~nm of the protein wall. For water molecules, this phenomenon is modelled as a sharp increase of 
the fluid viscosity within $\approx1.0$~nm distance from the wall. The values for the diffusion coefficient 
were taken directly from ref. \citenum{Simakov-2010}, who used an empirical fit on molecular dynamics data 
from ref. \citenum{Makarov-1998}. The inverse relative viscosity data was taken directly from the molecular 
dynamics study in ref. \citenum{Pronk-2014}, and fitted with a logistic function after offsetting for the 
protein hydrodynamic radius.
