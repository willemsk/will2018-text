\footnotesize
Cytolysin A (ClyA) is a protein nanopore that has become a valuable tool for the detection, characterization
and analysis of bio-markers, proteins and nucleic acids at the single-molecule level. While ClyA has been
engineered extensively towards these applications, a full understanding of its transport properties and the
scale of the electrophoretic forces inside it is currently lacking. From this perspective we have built a
2D-axisymmetric model of ClyA that accurately captures its geometry and charge distribution to numerically
compute the flux of ions and water through the pore. To achieve this we developed an extended version of the
steady-state Poison-Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes (ePNP-NS) equations that makes use of self-consistent
concentration- and positional-dependencies for the ion diffusion coefficients and mobilities, as well as the
solvent density, viscosity and relative permittivity. In this study we show that our model is able to
reproduce the experimentally observed ionic currents over a wide range of ionic strengths and applied
voltages. We further describe the influence of these latter two parameters on various quantities of interest,
including the cation and anion concentrations inside the pore, the shape of the electrostatic potential
landscape and the magnitude and direction of the electro-osmotic flow. Our work shows that continuum models of
biological nanopores -- if the appropriate corrections are applied -- can make meaningful predictions both
qualitatively and quantitatively.

\section{Introduction}

The transport of ions and molecules through nanoscale geometries is a field of intense study using both
experimental, theoretical and computational methods.\cite{Sparreboom-2010,Bocquet-2010,Maffeo-2012,
Thomas-2014,Wang-2014,Kim-2015} One of the primary driving forces behind this research is the development of
nanopores as label-free, stochastic sensors at the ultimate analytical limit.\cite{Bayley-2001,
Dekker-2007,Venkatesan-2011,Zhang-2016} Such detectors have applications ranging from the analysis of
biopolymers, i.e. DNA\cite{Deamer-2016,Kasianowicz-1996,Meller-2000,Maglia-2008,Butler-2008,Stoddart-2009,
Franceschini-2013,Jain-2018} or proteins,\cite{Restrepo-Perez-2018,Talaga-2009,Rodriguez-Larrea-2013,
Nivala-2013,Kennedy-2016} to the detection and quantification of biomarkers,\cite{Chen-2013,Soskine-2012,
Niedzwiecki-2013,VanMeervelt-2014,Huang-2017,Liu-2018,Galenkamp-2018} to the fundamental study of chemical or
enzymatic reactions at the single molecular level.\cite{Willems-VanMeervelt-2017,Lieberman-2010,
Nivala-2013,Ho-2015,Laszlo-2017}

Nanopores are generally operated in the resistive-pulse mode where fluctuations of their ionic conductance are
monitored over time.\cite{Bayley-2001,Dekker-2007,Maglia-2010,Venkatesan-2011} This conductance is measured by
placing the nanopore between two electrolyte compartments and applying a constant DC (or AC) voltage
(\SIrange{0.001}{1}{\volt}) across them. Due to the high resistance of the nanopore, virtually the full
potential change occurs near and within the pore, resulting in a strong electrical field
(\SIrange{1e7}{1e8}{\mV\per\nm}) that electrophoretically drives ions and water molecules through the
pore.\cite{Wong-2007,Mao-2014,Haywood-2014,Laohakunakorn-2015} Hence, analyte molecules such as DNA or
proteins are driven towards and often \emph{through} the nanopore by a combination of Coulombic
(electrophoretic) and hydrodynamic (electro-osmotic) forces.\cite{Wong-2007,Grosberg-2010,Muthukumar-2010,
Muthukumar-2014} If successful such a translocation is observed as a temporal fluctuation in the ionic
conductance of the pore and serves as a unique molecular fingerprint with which the molecule can be
identified.\cite{Yusko-2017} The frequency, magnitude, duration and even noise levels of these events depend
on the properties of both the analyte molecule and the nanopore itself, making them notoriously difficult to
interpret efficiently without a full understanding of the nanofluidic phenomena that underlie them.

The computational approaches most widely used to study nanofluidic transport in ion channels or biological
nanopores comprise \emph{discrete} methods such as molecular dynamics (MD)\cite{Lynden-Bell-1996,
Allen-1999,Aksimentiev-2005,Luan-2008,Bhattacharya-2011,Zhang-2014,DiMarino-2015,Belkin-2016} and Brownian
dynamics (BD),\cite{Schirmer-1999,Im-2002,Noskov-2004,Millar-2008,Egwolf-2010,DeBiase-2015,Pederson-2015}
and \emph{mean-field} (continuum) methods such as the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equations\cite{Grochowski-2008,
Baldessari-2008-1} and Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations,\cite{Eisenberg-1996,Gillespie-2002,
Simakov-2010}. The latter can be coupled with the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation to include the electro-osmotic
flow.\cite{Lu-2012,Pederson-2015} Due to their explicit atomic or particle nature, MD and BD simulations are
considered to yield the most accurate results. However, the large computational cost of simulating a complete
biological nanopore system (100K--1M atoms) 100s of nanoseconds still necessitates the use of
supercomputers.\cite{Aksimentiev-2005,Bhattacharya-2011} The PNP(-NS) equations, on the other hand, are of
particular interest due to their low computational cost and  analytical tractability. In a continuum approach,
all materials are represented by structureless media whose behavior is parameterized by material properties
such as relative permittivity, diffusion coefficient, electrophoretic mobility, viscosity and density. Because
these properties can only emerge from the collective behavior or interactions between small groups of atoms,
great care must be taken when using them to compute fluxes and fields at the
nanoscale.\cite{Corry-2000,Collins-2012} Nevertheless, the PNP equations have been used extensively for the
simulation of ion channels,\cite{Im-2002,Furini-2006,Liu-2015} biological
nanopores\cite{Simakov-2010,Pederson-2015,Aguilella-Arzo-2017,Simakov-2018} and their solid-state
counterparts\cite{Cervera-2005,White-2008,Chaudhry-2014,Laohakunakorn-2015} -- often with excellent
qualitative, if not quantitative results.\cite{Maffeo-2012,Thomas-2014,Kim-2015}

To remedy the shortcomings of PNP and NS theory, a number of modifications have been proposed over the years.
These include, amongst others, 1) steric ion-ion interactions, 2) the effect of protein-ion/water interactions
on their motility, 3) the concentration dependencies of ion motility, and solvent relative permittivity,
viscosity and density.

The steric ion-ion interactions can be accounted for by computing the excess in chemical potential
($\mu_{i}^\text{ex}$) resulting from the finite size of the ions.\cite{Eisenberg-1996,Bazant-2009,
Daiguji-2010} Gillespie et al. combined PNP and density functional theory -- where $\mu_{i}^\text{ex}$ was
split up in ideal, hard-sphere and electrostatic components -- to successfully predicted the selectivity and
current of ion channels.\cite{Gillespie-2002} In another approach Kilic et al. derived a set of modified PNP
equations -- based on the free energy functional of the Borukhov's modified PB model\cite{Borukhov-1997} --
and observed significantly more realistic concentrations for high surface potentials compared to the classical
PNP equations.\cite{Kilic-2007} To allow for non-identical ion sizes and more than two ion species, this model
was later extended by Lu et al., who used it to probe the effect of finite ion size on the rate coefficients
of enzymes.\cite{Lu-2011}

The interaction of ions or small molecules like water with the heavy atoms of proteins or DNA results in a
strong reduction of their motility, as observed in MD simulations\cite{Makarov-1998,Pronk-2014} Since these
effects happen only for distances \SI{\le1}{\nm}, they can usually be neglected for macroscopic simulations.
However, in small nanopores ($\le10$~nm radius), they comprise a significant fraction of the total nanopore
radius and hence must be taken into account.\cite{Noskov-2004,Simakov-2010,Pederson-2015,McMullen-2017} In
continuum simulations, this can be corrected for by using a positional-dependent ion diffusion coefficients;
as was implemented in the so-called `soft-repulsion PNP' developed by Simakov and Kurnikova\cite{Simakov-2010,
Simakov-2018} to predict the ionic conductance of the $\alpha$-hemolysin nanopore. Similar reductions in ion
diffusion coefficients have been proposed to improve PNP theory's estimations of the ionic conductance of ion
channels.\cite{Furini-2006,Liu-2015} The motility of water molecules is expressed by the NS equations as the
fluid's viscosity. Hence, as also observed in MD simulations for water molecules near proteins\cite{Pronk-2014} and confined in hydrophilic nanopores,\cite{Vo-2016,Hsu-2017} the water-solid
interaction leads to a viscosity several times higher compared to the bulk values. Note that this is likely
only valid for hydrophilic interfaces, as the lack of interaction with hydrophobic interfaces, such as carbon
nanotubes, leads to a lower viscosity.\cite{Ye-2011}

It is well known that the self-diffusion coefficient $\diffusion_{i}$ and electrophoretic mobility
$\mobility_{i}$ of an ion $i$ depends on the local concentrations of all the ions in the
electrolyte.\cite{ContrerasAburto-2013-1} Their values typically decrease with increasing salt concentration,
and hence should not be treated as constants. Moreover, the well-known Nernst-Einstein (NE) relation
$\mobility_{i}=\diffusion_{i}/\kT$, while valid at infinite dilution and a good approximation at low
concentrations ($<10$~mM), significantly overestimates the ionic mobility at higher salt
concentrations.\cite{Mills-1989,Panopoulos-1986,ContrerasAburto-2013-1,ContrerasAburto-2013-2} In an empirical
approach, Baldessari and Santiago formulated an ionic-strength dependency of the ionic mobility based on their
activity coefficients\cite{Baldessari-2008-1} and showed excellent correspondence between the experimental and
simulated ionic conductance of long nanochannels over a wide concentration range.\cite{Baldessari-2008-2}
Alternatively, Burger et al. used a microscopic lattice-based model to derive a set of PNP equations with
non-linear, ion density-dependent mobilities and diffusion coefficients that provided significantly more
realistic results for ion channels.\cite{Burger-2012} Note that other electrolyte properties, such as its
viscosity,\cite{Hai-Lang-1996} density\cite{Hai-Lang-1996} and relative permittivity,\cite{Gavish-2016} also
significantly affect the ion and water flux. To better compute the charge flux in ion channels, Chen derived a
new PNP framework that includes a water-ion interactions in the form of a concentrations-dependent relative
permittivity and an additional ion-water interaction energy term.\cite{Chen-2016} Axelsson et al. derived a
set of NS equations that allowed for an incompressible fluid with a variable density and
viscosity.\cite{Axelsson-2015}

To the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to consolidate the corrections discussed above into a
single framework. Hence, we propose an extended set of PNP-NS (ePNP-NS) equations, which improves the
predictive power of the PNP-NS equations at the nanoscale and beyond infinite dilution. Our ePNP-NS framework
takes into account the finite size of the ions using a size-modified PNP theory,\cite{Lu-2011} and implements
spatial-dependencies for the solvent viscosity,\cite{Pronk-2014,Hsu-2017} the ion diffusion coefficients and
their mobilities.\cite{Makarov-1998,Noskov-2004} It also includes self-consistent concentration-dependent
properties, based on empirical fits to experimental data, for both the ions, in terms of diffusion
coefficients and mobilities,\cite{Baldessari-2008-1,Mills-1989} and the solvent, in terms of density,
viscosity\cite{Hai-Lang-1996} and relative permittivity\cite{Gavish-2016}. To validate our new framework, we
applied it directly to a 2D-axisymmetric model of the Cytolysin A (ClyA), a large protein nanopore, typically
containing 12 subunits\cite{Mueller-2009} or more\cite{Soskine-2013} that has been extensively used in
experimental studies of both proteins\cite{Soskine-2013,VanMeervelt-2014,Soskine-Biesemans-2015,
Biesemans-Soskine-2015,Wloka-2017,VanMeervelt-2017,Galenkamp-2018} and DNA.\cite{Franceschini-2013,
Franceschini-2016}. This allowed us to gauge the qualitative and quantitative performance of the
ePNP-NS equations and simultaneously provide a host of new information about the environment inside the pore.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In \emph{\nameref{sec:math_model}} we describe the
equations governing our ePNP-NS framework and detail the construction of the 2D-axisymmetric ClyA model. Next,
in \emph{\nameref{sec:results}}, we validate our model by direct comparison of simulated ionic conductances
with experimentally measured values. We then proceed to characterize the influence of the bulk ionic strength
and applied bias voltage on cation and anion concentrations inside the pore, the electrostatic potential
distribution and magnitude of the electro-osmotic flow. Finally, we touch upon our key finding and their
impact in \emph{\nameref{sec:conclusions}} and describe our protocols in more detail in
\emph{\nameref{sec:methods}}.

\section{Mathematical model}\label{sec:math_model}

The use of \emph{continuum} or \emph{mean-field} representations for both the nanopore and the electrolyte
enables us to efficiently computate the steady-state ion and water fluxes under almost any condition. The
dynamic behavior of our complete system is described by the coupled Poisson, Nernst-Planck and Navier-Stokes
(PNP-NS) equations, a set of well-known partial differential equations that describe the electrostatic field,
the total ionic flux and the fluid flow, respectively.\cite{Eisenberg-1996,Cervera-2005,Lu-2012} In this
section we will describe all the components of the simulation, i.e. the 2D-axisymmetric nanopore geometry and
the system of governing equations.

\subsection{Model geometry}

\paragraph{2D-axisymmetric model of ClyA} ClyA is a relatively large protein nanopore that self-assembles on
lipid bilayers to form $14$~nm long hydrophilic channels. The interior of the pore can be divided into roughly
two cylindrical compartments (\cref{fig:clya_side}): the \cis\ lumen ($\approx6$~nm diameter, $\approx10$~nm
height), and the \trans\ constriction ($\approx3.3$~nm diameter, $\approx4$~nm height). Because ClyA consists
of 12 identical subunits (\cref{fig:clya_top}), it exhibits a high degree of radial symmetry, a geometrical
feature that can be exploited to obtain meaningful results at a much lower computational
cost.\cite{Cervera-2005,Lu-2012, Pederson-2015} However, this requires the reduction of the full 3D atomic
structure and charge distribution into a realistic 2D-axisymmetric model. To this end, we constructed a
full-atom homology model of ClyA-AS type I---a dodecameric variant of the wild type ClyA from \textit{S.
Typhii} artificially evolved for improved stability\cite{Soskine-2013}---and equilibrated it at \SI{298.15}{\kelvin} for \SI{30}{\ns}. From the final extracted 50 sets of atomic
coordinates of a from an \emph{equilibrium} explicit solvent MD trajectory. For each of these structures, we
computed a 2D atomic density\cite{Li-2013} and charge\cite{Aksimentiev-2005} map (cfr. methods for details).
Both the density and the charge maps were averaged to capture the movements of the side chains. The geometry of the nanopore was then defined as the \SI{25}{\percent} contourline of the density map, which closely follows the outline of a
\SI{30}{\degree} wedge of the full atom structure (\cref{fig:model_geometry_vs_wedge}). The equilibrium charge
map (\cref{fig:model_charge_density}) was loaded directly into our solver as an interpolated function
($\scdpore$) and applied to the entire computational domain.

\paragraph{Global geometry.} The complete system (\cref{fig:model_geometry_zoom,fig:model_geometry}) consists
of a large hemispherical electrolyte reservoir ($R=\SI{250}{\nm}$), split through the middle into a \cis\ and
a \trans\ compartment by a lipid bilayer ($h=\SI{2.8}{\nm}$), which contains the nanopore at its center. Both
the bilayer and the nanopore are represented by dielectric blocks (cfr. \cref{tab:corrections_equations} for
parameters) that are impermeable to ions and water.


\subsection{Governing equations}

In an attempt to improve upon the quantitative accuracy of the PNP-NS equations for nanopore simulations, we
developed an \emph{extended} version of these equations (ePNP-NS) using the commercial finite element solver
COMSOL Multiphysics (www.comsol.com) that self-consistently takes into account 1) the finite size of the
ions,\cite{Borukhov-1997,Lu-2011} 2) the reduction of ion and water motility close to the nanopore
walls,\cite{Makarov-1998,Noskov-2004,Pronk-2014,Pederson-2015,Vo-2016} and 3) the concentration dependency of
ion diffusion coefficients and electrophoretic mobilities, as well as electrolyte viscosity, density and
relative permittivity.\cite{Mills-1989,Hai-Lang-1996,Gavish-2016} Most of these corrections were implemented
using emperical functions fitted to experimental data, which can be found in \cref{tab:corrections_equations}
and \cref{suppinfo:tab:corrections_parameters}, respectively.

\paragraph{Electrostatic field.} As mentioned above, the electrostatic potential is evaluated using Poisson's
equation
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:poisson}
  \nabla \cdot \left(\absperm \relperm \nabla \potential \right) = -\left( \scdpore + \scdion \right)
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
with electric potential $\potential$, vacuum permittivity $\absperm=\SI{8.85419e-12}{\farad\per\meter}$ and
local relative permittivity $\relperm$.

The pore's \emph{fixed} charge distribution $\scdpore$ was derived directly from the full atom model of
ClyA-AS (cfr. \cref{eq:scdpore}) and the \emph{ionic} charge density in the fluid is given by
\begin{align}\label{eq:scdion}
  \scdion = \faraday\sum_{i}\chargen_{i}\concentration_{i}
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
with Faraday's constant $\faraday= \SI{96485.33}{\coulomb\per\mole}$, ion concentration $\concentration_{i}$
and ion charge number $\chargen_{i}$ ($+1$ and $-1$ for \Na\ and \Cl\, respectively).

To account for the concentration dependence of the electrolyte's relative permittivity, we replaced its
constant value with the following expression
\begin{align}
  \relperm(\avionconc) = \relperm^0 \relperm^c(\avionconc)
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
with $\avionconc=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n}\concentration_{i}$ the average ion concencentration, $\relperm^0$ the
relative permittivity at infinite dilution and $\relperm^c(\avionconc)$ a concentration dependent empirical
function parameterized with experimental data.

\paragraph{Ionic flux.} The total ionic flux $\flux_{i}$ of each ion $i$ is given by the size-modified
Nernst-Planck equation,\cite{Lu-2011} and can be expressed as the sum of diffusive, electrophoretic,
convective and steric fluxes
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:sm-nernst-planck}
  \flux_{i} = -\left[
    \diffusion_{i} \nabla \concentration_{i}
    + \chargen_{i} \mobility_{i} \concentration_{i} \nabla \potential
    - \velocity \concentration_{i}
    + \vec{\beta_{i}} \concentration_{i} \right]
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  \vec{\beta_{i}} =
      \frac{ \ionsize_{i}^3 / \ionsize_{0}^3 \dsum_{j} \ionsize_{j}^3 \nabla \concentration_{j} }
           { 1 - \dsum_{j} \avogadro \ionsize_{j}^3 \concentration_{j} }
   \text{\,,}
\end{align}
and at steady state
\begin{align}
  \dfrac{\delta \concentration_{i}}{\delta t} ={}& - \nabla \cdot \flux_{i} = 0
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
with ion diffusion coefficient $\diffusion_{i}$, concentration $\concentration_{i}$, charge number
$\chargen_{i}$, electrophoretic mobility $\mobility_{i}$, electrostatic potential $\potential$, fluid velocity
$\velocity$ and Avogadro's constant $\avogadro = \SI{6.022e23}{\per\mole}$. $\ionsize_{i}$ and $\ionsize_{0}$
are \emph{steric} cubic diameters of respectively ions and water molecules. Because currently there are no
experimentally verified values available for $\ionsize_{i}$ and $\ionsize_{0}$, we set them to \SI{0.5}{\nm}
and \SI{0.311}{\nm}, such that their limiting concentrations correspond to \SI{13.3}{\Molar} and
\SI{55.2}{\Molar}, respectively.\cite{Bazant-2009}

The reduction of the ionic motility with increasing salt concentration and in proximity to the nanopore walls
was implemented self-consistently by replacing the constant values of $\diffusion_{i}$ and $\mobility_{i}$
with the following expressions
\begin{align}
  \diffusion_{i}(\avionconc,\walldistance) ={}&
      \diffusion_{i}^0 \diffusion_{i}^c(\avionconc) \diffusion_{i}^w(\walldistance)  \\
  \mobility_{i}(\avionconc,\walldistance) ={}&
      \mobility_{i}^0 \mobility_{i}^c(\avionconc) \mobility_{i}^w(\walldistance)
\end{align}
where $\diffusion_{i}^0$ and $\mobility_{i}^0$ represent the values at infinite dilution. The concentration
dependent factors $\diffusion_{i}^c(\avionconc)$ and $\mobility_{i}^c(\avionconc)$ are empirical functions
fitted to experimental data of respectively the ion self-diffusion coefficient and the electrophoretic
mobility for solutions between \SIrange{0}{5}{\Molar} \ce{NaCl}.\cite{Mills-1989,Bianchi-1989,
Currie-1960,Goldsack-1976,DellaMonica-1979} Likewise, the factors $\diffusion_{i}^w(\walldistance)$ and
$\mobility_{i}^w(\walldistance)$ are empirical functions that introduce a spatial dependency on the distance
from the nanopore wall $\walldistance$, and were parameterized by fitting to molecular dynamics data.\cite{
Noskov-2004,Simakov-2010,Makarov-1998}

Based on the observation that the diffusivity of nanometer- to micrometer-sized particles reduces
significantly when confined in pores and slits of comparable dimensions,\cite{Renkin-1954,Deen-1987,
Dechadilok-2006,Muthukumar-2014,Kannam-2017} Simakov et al.\cite{Simakov-2010} and Pederson et
al.\cite{Pederson-2015} reduced the ion motilities inside the pore as a function of the ratio between the ion
and the nanopore radii. We chose not to include this correction into our model, as extrapolating its
applicability for ions with a hydrodynamic radii comparable to size of the solvent is
questionable.\cite{Anderson-1972,Deen-1987}

\paragraph{Fluid flow.} The fluid flow and pressure are given by the Navier-Stokes equations for
incompressible fluids\cite{Axelsson-2015}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:navier-stokes-variable}

\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  \hydrostresstensor =
  \pressure\identity - \viscosity\left[\nabla\velocity+\left(\nabla\velocity \right)^\mathsf{T}\right]
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
together with the continuity equations for the fluid density
\begin{align}
  \velocity \cdot \nabla \density  = 0
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
and the fluid velocity
\begin{align}
  \left( \velocity \cdot \nabla \right) \left( \density\velocity \right)
  \nabla \cdot \left( \density\velocity \right) - \velocity \cdot \nabla \density ={}& 0
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
with fluid velocity $\velocity$, density $\density$, hydrodynamic stress tensor $\hydrostresstensor$,
viscosity $\viscosity$ and pressure $\pressure$. The external body force density $\vec{\force}$ that acts on
the fluid is given by
\begin{align}
\vec{\force} = \echarge\avogadro\scdion\efield
\text{\,,}
\end{align}
with $\efield = - \nabla \potential$ the electrical field vector.

As with the previous equations, we introduced a concentration dependency and wall distance dependencies for
$\viscosity$ and a concentration dependeny for the $\density$ by replacing their constant values by
\begin{align}
  \viscosity(\avionconc,\walldistance) ={}&
    \viscosity^0 \viscosity^c(\avionconc) \viscosity^w(\walldistance) \\
  \density(\avionconc) ={}&
    \density^0 \density^c(\avionconc)
\end{align}
where $\viscosity^0$ and $\density^0$ are the values at infinite dilution, i.e. pure water,
$\viscosity^c(\avionconc)$, $\density^c(\avionconc)$ and $\viscosity^w(\walldistance)$ are empirical functions
parameterized via fitting to experimental\cite{Hai-Lang-1996} and molecular dynamics\cite{Pronk-2014} data
obtained from literature.

\paragraph{Boundary conditions} The reservoir boundaries were used to mimic electrodes by grounding the \cis\
side ($\potential = 0$) and setting a fixedbias voltage at \trans\ ($\potential = \vbias$) as Dirichlet
boundary conditions. To mimic an endless reservoir, the ion concentration at both external boundaries was set
to a fixed value ($\concentration_i = \cbulk$) and a no normal stress condition was used
($\hydrostresstensor\vec{n} = 0$) to allow for the unconstrained flow in and out of the computational domain.
The boundary conditions on the edges of the reservoir shared with the nanopore and bilayer were set to no-flux
($-\vec{n}\cdot\vec{\flux}_{i} = 0$) and no-slip ($\vec{\velocity} = 0$) to prevent the flux of ions through
them and to mimic a sticky hydrophilic surface, respectively. Finally, a Neumann boundary condition was
applied at the bilayer external boundary ($-\vec{n}\cdot\left(\absperm \relperm \nabla \potential \right) =
0$).

\paragraph{Note on the concentration dependencies.} All concentration dependent parameters use the average
local ion concentration rather than their individual concentrations. While valid for \emph{electroneutral}
bulk solutions, this approximation no longer holds inside the electrical double layer, i.e. near charged
surfaces or inside small nanopores, where local electroneutrality is violated. The main reasons for making
this simplification are the lack of non-bulk experimental data and the absence of a tractable analytical
model. Nevertheless, we will see that the current concentration dependent functions will lead to an excellent
agreement with the experimental data in all but the most extreme cases, justifying our choice \textit{a
posteriori}.

\paragraph{PNP-NS vs. ePNP-NS} The ePNP-NS equations can be converted with ease into the regular PNP-NS
equations disabling the steric flux, i.e. $\vec{\beta}=0$ and by setting all concentration and wall distance
functions to unity, such that $\relperm = \relperm^0$, $\diffusion_{i} = \diffusion_{i}^0$, $\mobility_{i} =
\mobility_{i}^0$, $\viscosity = \viscosity^0$ and $\density = \density^0$.

\section{Results and discussion}\label{sec:results}

The current-voltage (IV) relationships of many nanopores, ClyA included, often deviate significantly from
Ohm's law. This is because the ionic flux results from a complex interplay between the pore's geometry (size,
shape and charge distribution), the properties of the surrounding electrolyte (salt concentration/type,
viscosity, ...) and any externally applied conditions (bias voltage, temperature, pressure, ...). The ability
of a computational model to quantitatively predict the ionic current of a nanopore over a wide range of bias
voltages and salt concentrations strongly indicates that it captures the essential physics governing the
nanofluidic transport. Hence, to validate our model we experimentally measured the single channel ionic
conductance of ClyA at a wide range of salt concentrations and bias voltages, and compared them with the
simulated ionic transport properties, in terms of current, conductance, rectification and ion selectivity, of
both the classical PNP-NS and the newly developed ePNP-NS equations. After validation, we proceed with
describing the influence of bias voltage and bulk ionic strengths on the local ion concentrations inside the
pore and the resulting electrical double layer. This is followed by a characterization of the electrostatic
potential and the electrostatic energy landscape within ClyA for both cations and anions. We will conclude
this section by discussing the properties of the electro-osmotic flow.

\subsection{Transport of ions through ClyA}\label{sec:ion_transport}

\input{fig_conductance.tex}

\paragraph{Ionic current.}
To gauge the accuracy of our 2D-axisymmetric ClyA-AS model, we experimentally measured the current--voltage
(IV) curves of single ClyA-AS nanopores (between \SIrange[retain-explicit-plus]{-150}{+150}{\mV} and at 0.05,
0.15, 0.5, 1 and \SI{3}{\Molar} \ce{NaCl}) and compared them directly to the values obtained from steady-state
simulations using both the classical PNP-NS and the new ePNP-NS equations (\cref{fig:current-voltage_curves},
cfr. \nameref{sec:methods} for experimental and computational details). Over the entire investigated
concentration range, the IVs from the ePNP-NS model closely corresponded to the measured values ($<5\%$
error). In contrast, the PNP-NS equations significantly overestimate the ionic current for all measured
concentrations, particularly at high salt concentrations where most parameters deviate significantly from
their `infinite dilution' values (\cref{suppinfo:fig:corrections}). Interestingly, the opposite behavior is
observed for ePNP-NS, with virtually no error at high ionic strengths and minor discrepancies at lower salt
concentrations (\SI{<0.5}{\Molar}). At low ionic strengths, the electrical double layers inside the pore are
likely to overlap, resulting in nanopore occupied predominantly by cations. Because our ionic mobilities are
derived from bulk ionic conductances, i.e. for unconfined ions in a locally \emph{electroneutral} environment,
it is likely that our mobility model begins to break down under these conditions.\cite{Duan-2010} Regardless
of these minor discrepancies, it is clear that our simplified, 2D-axisymmetric model, in conjunction with the
ePNP-NS equations, is able to accurately compute the ionic current through ClyA. Hence, this methodology
should be applicable to other small nanopores ($r_{\text{pore}}\approx1.5$~nm) with complex geometries and
charge distributions.

% Difference in conductance mechanism between high and low salt
\paragraph{Ionic conductance.} To further our understanding of ClyA's ionic transport properties, we computed
its ionic conductance $\conductance=\current / \vbias$ between \num{0.005} to \SI{5}{\Molar} \ce{NaCl} and
from \num{-200} to \SI[retain-explicit-plus]{+200}{\mV}.

The near horizontal contour lines of the conductance heatmap (\cref{fig:conductance_contourmap_epnp}, left) at high salt concentration ($\cbulk>\SI{1}{\Molar}$) show that at high ionic strengths, ClyA maintains the same $\conductance$ regardless of the applied bias voltage. This starts to change at intermediate ionic strengths ($\SI{0.1}{\Molar}<\cbulk<\SI{1}{\Molar}$), where maintaining of the same conductance level requires increasing salt concentrations with increasing negative bias amplitudes. Finally, at low salt concentrations ($\cbulk<\SI{0.1}{\Molar}$), the ionic conductance increases when reducing the negative voltage amplitude but subsequently reaches a plateau at positive bias voltages.


The straight slopes of the concentration-conductivity log-log plot at
$-150$~mV exhibit a clear `kink' at $\approx0.15$~M, suggesting the presence of two different conductance
regimes. At low ionic strengths ($0.005\le\cbulk\le0.15$~M) and high negative bias voltages ($>-100$~mV)
fitting with the power law function $\conductance(\cbulk)=a\cbulk^{\gamma}$ yields an exponent that
asymptotically approaches $\gamma=1/2$. This suggests that the transport mechanism is dominated by the charge
density inside the pore, which is determined by the electrical double layer which as well has a square-root
dependence on the bulk concentration $\cbulk$.\cite{Uematsu-2018} Under all other conditions, $\gamma$ yields
values between $0.5$ and $?$

($0.3\le\cbulk\le1.5$~M)
 yielded exponents $\gamma$ of
\num{0.4984} and \num{1.000}, respectively. while the linear dependency on $\cbulk$
is commonly observed at high salt concentrations\todo{ref}, the square-root dependency at low salt suggests a
transport mode dominated by the surface charge density due to the overlapping of the electrical double
layers. These mechanisms are less well defined at high positive bias voltages, however, as
fitting yielded $\gamma$ value of $0.614$~$\text{M}^{-1}$ and $0.787$~$\text{M}^{-1}$ for low and high
concentrations, respectively. Hence, while there are clearly two distinct ion transport modes at high
negative bias voltages, the converging exponents at high positive voltages suggest a `hybrid' mode with
characteristics of both regimes.

\paragraph{Ionic current rectification.}
A nanopore exhibits ionic current rectification (ICR) when the conductance for a given bias voltage magnitude
is higher when it is applied to one side of the nanopore compared to the other. Here, we define the ICR as
\begin{equation}
  \icr(\vbias) = \dfrac{\conductance(+\vbias)}{\conductance(-\vbias)}
\end{equation}
i.e. the ratio between the conductance at positive and negative bias voltages of equal magnitude.
ICR is a phenomenon often observed in nanopores that are both charged and contain a degree of geometrical
asymmetry along the central axis of the pore. With it's high negative charge ($-72~\elementarycharge$ at
pH~7.5) and different \cis\ ($\approx3.3$~nm) and \trans\ ($\approx6$~nm) entry diameters, ClyA fulfills
both conditions and hence exhibits a strong degree of rectification. The simulated concentration-voltage
landscape of $\icr$ was plotted in \cref{fig:conductance_rectification_contourmap_epnp} (left), together with
cross-sections at $50$, $100$ and $150$~mV (right) for comparison with the experimentally measured values.
Starting at $0.005$~M, $\icr$ rises rapidly with concentration until a maximum is reached at $\approx0.15$~M,
after which it falls towards unity at $5$~M. While a good qualitative agreement is found with the
experimental data over the entire range, $\icr$ matches quantitatively only for $\cbulk > 0.5$~M. In general,
the simulation overestimates the rectification, particularly at the maximum and at high bias voltages, with
$\icr$ values of $1.20$, $1.43$ and $1.69$ for the simulation and $1.14$, $1.28$ and $1.46$ for the
experiment at $50$, $100$ and $150$~mV, respectively.

\paragraph{Ion selectivity.}
The ion selectivity of a nanopore determines the preference with which it transports one ion type over the
other. Here, we represent the ClyA's ion selectivity by the apparent \ce{Na+} transport number
\begin{align*}
  \transportn_{\ce{Na+}} =
  \dfrac{\conductance_{\ce{Na+}}}{\conductance} =
  \dfrac{\conductance_{\ce{Na+}}}{\conductance_{\ce{Na+}} + \conductance_{\ce{Cl-}}},
\end{align*}
i.e. the fraction of the total current that is carried by \ce{Na+} ions
(\cref{fig:transport_number_contourmap_epnp}). As expected from its negatively charged interior, ClyA is
cation selective ($\tna > 0.5$) for all investigated voltages up to a reservoir salt concentration of
$\approx2$~M, after which it drops below $0.5$ to a minimum value of $0.45$ at $5$~M. The latter is
$\approx1.27\times$ its value in bulk, indicating that even at saturation ClyA is preferential towards
cations. Between $0.05 < \cbulk < 1$~M, $\tna$ decays logarithmically ($\tna(\cbulk)=a+b\log\cbulk$) with
slopes $b=-0.40$ and $-0.29$ for $-150$ and $+150$~mV, respectively.
\todo{What do these different slopes mean?}
At low concentrations and high applied bias voltages (below $10$~mM and $50$~mM for $+150$ and $-150$~mV,
respectively), $\tna$ is observed to exceed unity. Under these conditions, the convective flux of \Cl\
becomes slightly larger than its opposing electromigratory flux, resulting in an overall negative
contribution of \Cl\ to the ionic current.

\subsection{Ion concentration distribution}\label{sect:ion_concentration}
\input{fig_concentration.tex}
To further elucidate the origin of the current rectification and ion selectivity, we evaluated  the effect of
reservoir salt concentration and the bias voltage on the distribution of cation and anion densities inside
ClyA (\cref{fig:concentration}) and the accumulation of mobile charges as a result of their asymmetry
(\cref{fig:ion_charge_density}).

\paragraph{Relative cation and anion concentrations.}
At high reservoir concentrations ($\cbulk > 1$~M), the lumen of the pore becomes fully screened from the
negative charges that line it, leading to bulk-like conditions ($\pav{\ci/\cbulk}{p}\approx1$) for both
positive and negative ions. At lower concentrations however, the reduced screening gives rise to an
overlapping electrical double layer, which results in the enhancement of cations and the depletion of anions.
The magnitude of these effects appears to follow a power law at low concentrations ($\cbulk=0.005$ to
$0.05$~M), with exponents of $-0.910\pm0.010$ and $0.778\pm0.015$ for \Na\ and \Cl\, respectively. The \Na\
concentrations exhibit at most a 2 to 3-fold increase when $\vbias$ changes from $\vbias=-150$ to $+150$~mV.
In contrast, the number of \Cl\ ions inside pore between those 2 bias voltages can differ more than 10-fold
at reservoir concentrations below $0.1$~M, with a high degree of depletion at negative voltages.

The contourplots of the relative ion concentrations ($\ci/\cbulk$) at $\cbulk=0.15$~M
(\cref{fig:concentration_contours}) reveal that the \trans\ constriction ($1.85\text{~nm}<z<1.60\text{~nm}$)
remains depleted of anions and enhanced in cations for both $\vbias=-100$ and $+100$~mV. This is not the
case in the lumen ($1.60\text{~nm}<z<12.25\text{~nm}$), where the \Na\ concentration is bulk-like and
enhanced for $\vbias<0$ and $\vbias>0$, respectively. Conversely, the number of \Cl\ ions becomes more and
more depleted in the lumen for increasing negative bias magnitudes, while it is virtually bulk-like at higher
positive bias voltages. This is further exemplified by the radial profiles through the middle of the
constriction ($z=-0.3$~nm) and the lumen ($z=5$~nm) (\cref{fig:concentration_radial_profiles}) which also
clearly show the formation of the electrical double layer.

Note that the figures given above were obtained from a nanoscale continuum steady-state simulation, and hence
represent a time-averaged situation (typically on the order of \SIrange{10}{100}{\ns}).\todo{REF}

\paragraph{Ion charge density.}
\input{fig_ion_charge_density.tex}
The formation of an electrical double layer inside the pore and the resulting asymmetry in the cation and
anion concentrations results in a net charge density inside the pore ($\scdion$, \cref{eq:scdion}). At
reservoir concentrations \SI{\le0.5}{\Molar}, the electrical double layer (EDL) inside the pore is very
diffuse and overlaps significantly (\cref{fig:ion_charge_density_contours}, 3 leftmost panels). Moreover, the
absence of anions prevents the formation of any significant negative charge densities next to the few
positively charged residues lining the pore walls. The situation at high salt concentrations (e.g.
\SI{5}{\Molar}) is very different, with almost no charge density within the `bulk' of the pore lumen
($\walldistance\ge\SI{0.5}{\nm}$), but with pockets of highly charged and alternating pockets of positive and
negative charge densities close to the nanopore wall (\cref{fig:ion_charge_density_contours}, rightmost
panel). This sharp confinement is shown clearly by the radial density profiles
(\cref{fig:ion_charge_density_radial_profiles}) through the constriction ($z=-\SI{0.3}{\nm}$) and the lumen
($z=\SI{5}{\nm}$).

Integration of $\scdion$ over `bulk' ($d\ge\SI{0.5}{\nm}$) and surface ($d<\SI{0.5}{\nm}$) volumes inside the
pore yields respectively $\pav{\Qion}{b}$ and $\pav{\Qion}{s}$, i.e. the average number of mobile charges
present inside those locations (\cref{fig:ion_charge_pore_bulk_surface_total_vs_concentration}). While total
number of charges inside the pore $\pav{\Qion}{p} = \pav{\Qion}{b} + \pav{\Qion}{s}$ rises appreciatively with
increasing reservoir concentration, the majority of these additional charges are confined to the surface of
the pore. Up until \SI{0.1}{\Molar}, $\pav{\Qion}{p}$ is distributed equally between the surface and bulk
layers (\SI{\approx+27}{\ec} and \SI{\approx+22}{\ec} , respectively). At higher concentrations, the number of
ions in the surface layer rises (to \SI{+58}{\ec} at \SI{5}{\Molar}), while that in the bulk pore diminishes
(\SI{+0}{\ec}  at \SI{5}{\Molar}). $\pav{\Qion}{p}$ also depends on the applied bias voltage, as it is
\SIrange{+10}{+15}{\ec} higher at \SI{+150}{\mV} compared to \SI{-150}{\mV}.


\subsection{Electrostatic potential}\label{sect:electrostatic_potential}

\input{fig_potential.tex}

In nanometer sized pores, the modification of the electrostatic potential distribution by the charged
residues embedded in the interior walls of the protein (\cref{fig:potential_clya_charges}), significantly
influences the transport of ions and water molecules.\cite{Bhattacharya-2011}\todo{more ref}
In the following section we aim to describe the most salient features of this modulated potential and its
relative importance over the entire investigated concentration range.

\paragraph{Global electrostatic potential.} The electrostatic potential distribution at $\vbias=\SI{0}{\mV}$
clearly shows the influence of the nanopore's fixed charge distribution (\cref{fig:potential_contours}). At
low ionic strengths ($\cbulk < \SI{0.15}{\Molar}$), the lack of sufficient ionic screening results in
relatively uniform negative potentials in both the lumen and the constriction of the pore (\SI{-90}{\mV} and
\SI{-53}{\mV} at respectively \SI{0.005}{\Molar} and \SI{0.05}{\Molar}). These values significantly exceed the
single ion thermal voltage $\kTe=\SI{25.7}{\mV}$ and hence effectively prohibit anions from entering the pore.
At intermediary concentrations, ($0.15 \le \cbulk < \SI{1}{\Molar}$) the influence of the negative charges
increasingly confines itself to several `hotspots' near the nanopore walls, most notably at entry of the pore
($10<z<\SI{12}{\nm}$), in the middle of the lumen ($4<z<\SI{6}{\nm}$). While the potential at the center of
the pore is close to \SI{\approx0}{\mV} for the lumen, it remains uniformly negative for the constriction.
Finally, at high concentrations ($\cbulk \ge \SI{1}{\Molar}$) the potential drops to \SI{\approx0}{\mV} over
the entire lumen of the pore, with only a small negative potential inside the constriction.

\paragraph{Radially averaged potential profile.}
We further quantified the electrostatic potential at \SI{0}{\mV} applied bias voltage along the nanopore's
length by computing its radial average
\begin{align}
\radpot=\dfrac{1}{\pi R(z)^2}\int_{0}^{R(z)}\potential(r,z) \;2 \pi r \; dr \text{,}
\end{align}
where $R(z)$ is taken as the pore radius for $-1.85\le z \le \SI{12.25}{\nm}$, \SI{2}{\nm} for
$z<\SI{-1.85}{\nm}$ and \SI{4}{\nm} for $z>\SI{12.25}{\nm}$ (\cref{fig:potential_radial_averages}). The
electrostatic potential at the \cis\ entry ($z \approx \SI{10}{\nm}$) is dominated by the acidic residues
D114, D121 and D122, resulting in a rapid reduction of $\radpot$ upon entering the pore. Next, $\radpot$
remains approximately constant up until the middle of the lumen ($z \approx \SI{5}{\nm}$), where the next set
of negative residues, namely E53, E57 and D64, reduce the potential even further. After a brief rise,
$\radpot$ then attains its maximum amplitude inside the \trans\ constriction ($z \approx \SI{0}{\nm}$) due to
the close proximity of the amino acids E7, E11, E18, D21 and D25. For example, at physiological salt
concentrations ($0.15$~M), $\radpot$ has values of \SIlist{-19;-29;-57}{\mV}
(\numlist{-0.74;-1.1;-2.2}~$\kTe$) at the \cis\ entry, lumen center and \trans\ constriction, respectively.
Their magnitude increases approximately three-fold at \SI{0.005}{\Molar}, and drops to
\SI{\approx10}{\percent} at \SI{5}{\Molar}. A summary of these values can be found in
\cref{suppinfo:tab:radial_potential}.

\subsection{Electrostatic energy}

and to link it back to the observed ionic conductance properties through the average electrostatic energy of
cations and anions (\cref{fig:potential_energy}).

Due to it's small size, the majority of an applied bias potential drops along the length of the nanopore,
giving rise to a `tilted' version of the electrostatic potential at $0$~mV. ClyA's geometric asymmetry
results in different electrostatic landscapes for positive and negative bias voltages. Since electromigration
is the primary contributor to the ionic current, a proper understanding of the electrostatic energy barriers
the ions must overcome when traversing the pore should provide a more quantitative explanation for the origin
of ClyA's rectification, ion selectivity and asymmetric ion concentrations. To this end, we computed the
radially averaged electrostatic energy for monovalent ions  $\radenergy = \chargen_{i} \echarge \radpot$
(\cref{fig:potential_energy_radial_averages}) and the magnitude of the energy barriers at the \trans\
constriction ($\deltaEt$, \cref{fig:potential_energy_trans_barrier}).

\input{fig_potential_energy.tex}

\paragraph{Energy landscape at $\mathbf{+150}$~mV.}
At positive bias voltages, cations traverse the pore from \trans\ to \cis\
(\cref{fig:potential_energy_radial_averages}, top left). Upon entering the \trans\ constriction, the
electrostatic energy drops dramatically, followed by a relatively flat energy landscape with a small barrier
for entry in the lumen at $z\approx1.6$~nm . At very low ionic strengths ($\cbulk<0.025$~M), the energy at
\trans\ is significantly lower than that the final energy in the \cis\ compartment (e.g.
$\Delta\radenergy>2$~$\kT$ at $0.005$~M), forcing the ions to accumulate inside the pore. At higher
concentrations ($\cbulk>0.05$~M), the increased screening smooths out the potential drop inside the pore,
allowing the cations to migrate unhindered across the entire length of the pore.

Anions travelling from \cis\ to \trans\ must overcome energy barriers when both entering and exiting the pore
(\cref{fig:potential_energy_radial_averages}, bottom right). The former prevents \Cl\ ions from entering the
pore, but is only relevant at lower ionic strengths ($\cbulk<0.05$~M), since its magnitude is attenuated
strongly with increasing salt concentration (from $\approx1.7$~$\kT$ at $0.005$~M to $\approx0.5$~$kT$ at
$0.05$~M). Once inside the lumen, anions can move relatively unencumbered to the \trans\ constriction, where
they face the second, more significant energy barrier, which prevents them from fully translocating and
causes them to accumulate inside the lumen. Ions that do pass the final barrier are rewarded with a large
reduction of their electrostatic energy, as the bulk of the voltage drop occurs only after the \trans\
constriction. As with the cations, an increase in the ionic strength significantly reduces the

\paragraph{Energy landscape at $\mathbf{-150}$~mV.}
The electrostatic energy of cations traversing the pore at negative voltages (\cis\ to \trans) drops
gradually throughout the lumen of the pore up until the \trans\ constriction
(\cref{fig:potential_energy_radial_averages}, top right). This their efficient removal of cations
from the pore lumen, and results in a lower concentration compared to positive voltages
(\cref{fig:concentration}). To fully exit from the pore, however, cations must overcome a large energy
barrier, which reduces the nanopore's ability to conduct cations compared to positive potentials and hence
contributes to the ion current rectification.

The situation for anions at negative bias voltages (\trans\ to \cis)is very different as they must travel
from  (\cref{fig:potential_energy_radial_averages}, bottom left), where they must overcoming the
large energy barrier at the constriction (\cref{fig:potential_energy_trans_barrier}, red curves). This
effectively prevents them from entering the pore, explaining why ClyA is more ion selective at negative
bias voltages. Once across the barrier, the continuous drop of electrostatic energy towards the \cis\ entry
serves as a strong driving force to deplete the entire lumen of anions, resulting in much lower
concentrations compared to positive voltages.

\paragraph{Concentration and voltage dependencies of the \trans\ energy barrier.}
Many biological nanopores contain constrictions that play crucial roles in shaping their ionic
conductance properties.\cite{Maglia-2008,Franceschini-2016,Huang-2017} The reason for this is two-fold, 1)
the narrowest part dominates the overall resistance of the pore and 2) confinement of charged residues
results in much large electrostatic energy barriers. With its highly negatively charged \trans\
constriction, ClyA  affinity for transport of anions is diminished while that for cations in enhanced, even
at high ionic strengths (\cref{fig:transport_number_contourmap_epnp}).\cite{Soskine-2013}
To further elucidate the significance of the \trans\ electrostatic barrier ($\deltaEt$), we quantified its
height of at positive and negative voltages as a function of the salt concentration
(\cref{fig:potential_energy_trans_barrier}).



We estimated the magnitude of the
For concentrations between $0.01$ and $1$~M, however, there is a clear difference in ion selectivity between
positive and negative bias voltages. At $0.1$~M, for example, the ion selectivity
$\transportn_{\Na}$ increases $3.3$-fold from $5.7$ at $+150$~mV
to $19$ at $-150$~mV. The energy barriers under these conditions are This observation can be explained by the
difference in electrostatic energy barrier height in the constriction at positive and negative voltages
(\cref{fig:potential_energy_trans_barrier}). Again, at $0.1$~M the

\subsection{Electro-osmotic flow}
\input{fig_flow.tex}
The electro-osmotic flow (EOF) is one of the most important properties of biological nanopores, as it allows
for the capture of nucleic acids\cite{Wong-2007}, peptides\cite{Huang-2017} and
proteins
\cite{Soskine-2012,Soskine-2013,VanMeervelt-2014,Soskine-Biesemans-2015,Biesemans-Soskine-2015,Wloka-2017}
irrespective of their charge. In the following section we aim to quantitatively and a qualitatively describe
the influence of bias voltage and salt concentration on the EOF inside ClyA.

\paragraph{Direction, magnitude and radial velocity profile.}
The direction and magnitude of the EOF in a nanopore is generally determined by respectively the type of
charges (i.e. negative or positive) and their amount on its walls \todo{ref}. In the case of the
predominantly negatively charged ClyA, the EOF follows the direction of the cation, i.e. from \cis\ to
\trans\ for negative, and vice versa for positive bias voltages. Due to the conservation of mass, the EOF
velocity $U$ is predominantly a function of the nanopore radius. Hence, it is lowest in the lumen of the pore
and highest inside the \trans\ constriction (\cref{fig:flow_contour}). At the center of the pore, $U$ reaches
values of \SI{\approx0.07}{\mps} in the lumen and \SI{\approx0.21}{\mps} in the constriction (for
$\cbulk=0.5$~M and $\vbias=-100$~mV).

At low ionic strengths ($\cbulk<0.5$~M), the no-slip boundary condition on the nanopore walls and relatively
uniform positive charge density inside the pore result a parabolic radial velocity, similarly to a pressure
driven flow \todo{ref} (\cref{fig:flow_constriction_contour,fig:flow_constriction_profiles}). As the
ionic charge density $\scdion$ becomes increasingly confined to nanopore walls ($0.5\le\cbulk<1$~M,
\cref{fig:ion_charge_density}), the central maximum flattens out, resulting in the `plug' flow profile
typically observed for electro-osmotically driven flows \todo{ref}. Interestingly, at high salt
concentrations ($\cbulk\ge1$~M) the velocity at the center of the pore becomes lower than that at the walls.
\todo{why? lack of charge density in the lumen, complete confinement of charges to the wall?}

\paragraph{Water conductance and rectification.}
To more easily compare the total amount of water transported by ClyA between conditions, we computed the
electro-osmotic conductance $G_{\text{eo}} = Q_{\text{eo}}/V$ with $Q_{\text{eo}}$ the volumetric flow rate
obtained by integrating the water velocity over the reservoir boundary. \todo{voltage dependency}
$G_{\text{eo}}$ does not decrease monotonically with increasing salt concentrations, but rather exhibits a
maximum of \SI{\approx11.5}{\cnmpnspv} at $\approx0.5$~M. Tshow the expected monotonical depends

\subsection{The extended PNP-NS equations significantly improve the accuracy of continuum simulations at the
nanoscale.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Most important `corrections':
  \subitem concentration dependent ion diffusion coefficient and mobilities
  \subitem wall distance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ionic current rectification is caused by depletion of anions in the nanopore lumen at negative
bias voltages.}

\subsection{ClyA's ion selectivity is highly concentration and voltage dependent.}
While the ion selectivity can be estimated experimentally using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz
equation (GHKe),\cite{Franceschini-2016,Huang-2017} the asymmetric salt concentrations used to determine the
nanopore's reversal potential raises the question for which salt concentration this ion selectivity is valid.
Moreover, the many assumptions and simplifications used to derive the GHKe (Nernst-Einstein relation, no
convective transport, uniform electrical field over the pore) suggest that the ion selectivity calculated for
larger pores should be considered as a rough estimation only.

\subsection{The electro-osmotic flow exhibits a maximum at 0.5~M due to two competing concentration-dependent
effects.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Reduced double layer overlap and the appearance of alternating positive and negative space charge
  densities at the nanopore walls results in reduced electro-osmotic flow at higher salt concentrations.
  \item Poor electro-static screening of the highly negatively charged \trans\ constriction
  results in an body force that opposes the bulk flow of the nanopore and hence a diminishes the
  electro-osmotic flow magnitude at low salt concentrations.
  \item Both effect are weakest at $\approx0.5$~M, resulting in maximum at that concentration.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
We have developed an extended version of the Poison-Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes (ePNP-NS) equations and used
them to model the transport of ions and water through the biological nanopore ClyA. Our ePNP-NS equations take
into account the finite size of the ions and include a self-consistent, concentration- and
positional-dependent parametrization of the ionic transport coefficients (diffusion coefficient and mobility)
and the electrolyte properties (density, viscosity and relative permittivity).

We have verified our approach by matching experimental results to a very high degree of accuracy while
the model parameters where gauged on other experiments, ultimately leaving no degrees of freedom. This shows
that a continuum approach to modeling biological nanopores is not only feasible but to a very high degree
predictive.

Inaccuracies only arise in the low salt limit, leading to an experimentally unexplored fluid configuration
within the pore which almost only contains one ion species. It is likely that if proper model parameters for
this domain can be extracted from other sources, that the ePNP-NS equations will also be able to reproduce
experimental values under these conditions.

In the analysis of the operation of the biological nanopore with our model we found that the ionic currents
very much depend on the details of the electric field structure within the pore which define potential
barriers for the ion species. This of course means that the charge configuration of the protein needs to be
implemented accurately to obtain meaningful and predictive results and any simplifications regarding the pore
structure would likely deteriorate the results.

Following our analysis of ClyA, it stands to reason that other biological nanopores of comparable size can be
treated analogously and their properties could likely be mapped out systematically using our ePNP-NS model.


\section{Materials and methods}\label{sec:methods}

\paragraph{ClyA-AS homology model.} A full atom model of ClyA-AS\cite{Soskine-2013} was built and optimized
(MODELLER v9.18\cite{Sali-1993}) by introduction of the following point mutations in each of the 12 chains of
the wild-type ClyA crystal structure (PDBID: 2WCD\cite{Mueller-2009}): K8Q, N15S, Q38K, A57G, T67V, C87A,
A90V, A95S, L99Q, E103G, K118R, L119I, I124V, T125K, V136T, F166Y, K172R, V185I, K212N, K214R, S217T, T224S,
N227A, T244A, E276G, C285S, K290Q. Next, the conformation of all mutated side chains was optimized with an
double annealing protocol (heating: 150, 250, 400, 700 and \SI{1000}{\kelvin}, cooling: 1000, 800, 600, 500,
400 and \SI{300}{\kelvin}) where at each temperature the energy was minimized for 200 iterations with a
conjugate gradients algorithm (\SI{4}{\fs} timestep).\cite{Shanno-1980} The first anneal was performed solely
on the mutated residues themselves, while the second run also took the non-bonded interactions with the
neighboring atoms into account. The refined nanopore structure was then embedded in the center of an \SI{18 x
18}{\nm} equilibrated DPhPC lipid bilayer patch by manual removal of all overlapping lipids, resulting in 463
lipid molecules. The bilayer was created with the CHARMM-GUI\cite{Jo-2008} membrane builder\cite{Lee-2016} and
equilibrated with NAMD\cite{Phillips-2005}, as described in detail in ref. [\citenum{Wu-2014}]. The system was
then solvated in a box of \SI{18 x 18 x 32}{\nm} by addition of 214640 TIP3 water molecules (VMD solvate
plugin). The global charge was neutralized by replacing 1276 random water molecules with 674 \Na\ and 602 \Cl\
ions (VMD autoionize plugin).\cite{Humphrey-1996}

\paragraph{Molecular dynamics simulations.} Using molecular dynamics (MD) with NAMD 2.12 (\SI{2}{\fs}
timestep, CHARMM36 forcefield\cite{Best-2012}), the final system was minimized for \SI{5}{\ps}, heated from 0
to \SI{298.15}{\kelvin} in \SI{4}{\ps} and equilibrated for \SI{4}{\ns} as NpT
ensemble, .\cite{Aksimentiev-2005} Finally a \SI{30}{\ns} production run was performed using a NVT ensemble at
\SI{298.15}{\kelvin} and the atomic coordinates saved every \SI{5}{\ps}. Note that structural deterioration
was prevented by harmonically restraining the protein's C$_\alpha$ atoms to their original positions (spring
constant of \SI{695}{\pN\per\nm}) during all MD runs.\cite{Bhattacharya-2011}

\paragraph{Axially symmetric geometry.} The 2D-axisymmetric geometry of the ClyA-AS nanopore
(\cref{fig:model_geometry_vs_wedge}) was derived directly from its full atom model by radially averaging the
molecular density. Briefly, 50 sets of atomic coordinates were extracted from the final \SI{5}{\ns} of the
coordinates of the \SI{30}{\ns} MD production run (i.e. every \SI{100}{\fs}) and aligned by minimizing the RMSD between
their backbone atoms (VMD RMSD tool). Next, we computed and averaged the 3D-dimensional molecular density maps
of all 50 structures on a \SI{0.5}{\angstrom} resolution grid using the Gaussian function\cite{Li-2013}
\begin{align}\label{eq:denspore}
  \rho_\text{mol} = 1 - \displaystyle\prod_{i} \left[ 1 -
        \exp{\left(-\dfrac{-d_i^2}{(\stdev\atomradius_{i})^2}\right)} \right]
\end{align} where for each atom $i$,
$R_i$ is its Van der Waals radius, $d_i=\sqrt{(x-x_i)^2 + (y-y_i)^2 + (z-z_i)^2}$ is the distance of grid
coordinates $(x, y, z)$ from the atom center $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ and $\stdev = 0.93$ is a width factor. The
resulting 3D density map was then radially averaged along the z-axis, relative to the center of the pore to
obtain a 2D-axisymmetric density map. The contourline at \SI{25}{\percent} density was used as the nanopore
simulation geometry, after manual removal of overlapping and superfluous vertices to improve the quality of
the final computational mesh.

\paragraph{Axially symmetric charge density.}
The 2D-axially symmetric charge distribution was also derived directly from the 50 sets of aligned nanopore
coordinates (cf.~\cref{fig:model_charge_density}) that were used for the geometry. Inspired by how charges are
represented in the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method,\cite{Aksimentiev-2005} we computed the fixed charge
distribution of the nanopore $\scdpore(r,z)$ by assuming that an atom $i$ of partial charge
$\partialcharge_{i}$ at the location $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ in the full 3D atomistic pore model will contribute the
partial charge $\partialcharge_{i}/2\pi r_i$ to a point $(r_i,z_i)$ with $r_i = \sqrt{x_i^2 + y_i^2}$ in the
averaged 2D-axisymmetric model. That means we effectively spread the charge over all angles to achieve axial
symmetry. Following that, we assume a Gaussian distribution of the space charge density of each atom $i$
around its respective 2D-axisymmetric coordinates $(r_i,z_i)$ is
\begin{multline}
\label{eq:scdpore}
  \scdpore(r,z) = \\ \dsum_{i} \dfrac{\echarge\partialcharge_{i}}{\pi(\stdev\atomradius_{i})^2}
            \exp{\left(-\dfrac{(r-r_i)^2 + (z-z_i)^2}{(\stdev\atomradius_{i})^2}\right)}
\end{multline}
where $\atomradius_{i}$ is the atom radius, $\sigma = \num{0.5}$ is the sharpness factor and $\echarge$ is the
elementary charge. To embed $\scdpore$ with sufficient detail yet efficiently into a numeric solver, the
spatial coordinates are discretized with a grid spacing of $0.005$~nm in the domain of $\scdpore$ and
precomputed values are used during the solver runtime. All partial charges (at pH~7.5) and radii were taken
from the CHARMM36 forcefield\cite{Best-2012} and assigned using PROPKA\cite{Olsson-2011} and
PBD2PQR.\cite{Jurrus-2018}

\paragraph{Computing electrophoretic mobilities.}
To obtain the concentration-dependent ionic mobility  $\mobility^c_{i}$ from fitted functions, it must first
be derived from the salt's molar conductivity $\molarconductivity$ and the ion's transport number
$\transportn_{i}$ before it can be fitted\cite{ContrerasAburto-2013-1}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:conductivity-to-mobility}
\mobility_{i}(\concentration) = \frac{\specmolarconductivity_{i}(\concentration)}{\chargen_{i}\faraday}
\quad\text{with}\quad \specmolarconductivity_{i}(\concentration) = \molarconductivity(\concentration)
\transportn_{i}(\concentration),
\end{align}
where $\specmolarconductivity_{i}(\concentration)$ is the specific molar conductivity of ion $i$.

\paragraph{Computing the simulated ionic current.} The simulated ionic current $\currentsim$ at steady-state was computed by
\begin{equation}
  \currentsim = \faraday\int_{S}\left(\dsum_{i}\chargen_{i}\normvec\cdot\vec{\flux}_{i}\right)dS
\end{equation}
with $\chargen_{i}$ the charge number and $\vec{\flux}_{i}$ the total flux of each ion $i$ across \cis\ reservoir boundary $S$, $\faraday$ the Faraday constant (\SI{96485}{\coulomb\per\mole}) and $\normvec$ the
unit vector normal to $S$.


\paragraph{ClyA expression and purification.}
ClyA-AS monomers were expressed, purified and oligomerized using methods described in detail
elsewhere.\cite{Soskine-2012,Soskine-2013} Briefly, \textit{E. cloni} EXPRESS BL21 (DE3) cells (Lucigen
Corporation, Middleton, USA) were transformed with a pT7 plasmid containing the ClyA-AS gene, followed by
overexpression after induction with $1$~mM isopropyl \textbeta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich,
Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). The ClyA monomers were purified using \ce{Ni+}-NTA affinity chromatography and
oligomerized by incubation in $0.2$~\%\ D-maltoside n-dodecyl-\textbeta-D-maltopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich,
Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) for 30~minutes at 37\textdegree C. Pure ClyA-AS type-I (12-mer) nanopores were
obtained using native PAGE on a $4$-$15$\%\ gradient gel (Bio-Rad, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) and
subsequent excision of the correct oligomer band.

\paragraph{Recording of single-channel current-voltage curves.}
Experimental current-voltage curves where measured using single-channel electrophysiology, as detailed
elsewhere.\cite{Maglia-2010,Soskine-2012,Soskine-2013} Briefly, a black lipid bilayer was inside a
\SI{\approx100}{\um} diameter aperture in a thin teflon film separating two buffered electrolyte compartments
by painting with 1,2-diphytanoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhPC, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, USA).
Minute amounts ($\approx$) of the purified ClyA-AS type I oligimer were then added to the grounded \cis\
reservoir and allowed to insert into the lipid bilayer. Single-channel current-voltage curves were recorded
using a custom pulse protocol of the Clampex 10.4 software package connected to AxoPatch 200B patch-clamp
amplifier via a Digidata 1440A digitizer (all from Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA). Data was acquired at
$10$~kHz and filtered using a $2$-kHz low bandpass filter. Measurements at different ionic strengths were
performed at $\approx25$\textdegree C in aqueous \ce{NaCl} solutions, buffered at pH~$7.5$ using $10$~mM MOPS
(Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht,The Netherlands).
