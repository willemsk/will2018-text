\begin{abstract}
Biological nanopores have become valuable tools for the detection and analysis of molecules and the 
sequencing of nucleic acids at the single-molecule level. However, the physical understanding of the 
transport of ions and water across small nanopores and the scale the electrophoretic forces inside the 
nanopore is still superficial. From this perspective, we have built a detailed, 2D-axisymmetric continuum 
model of Cytolysin A (ClyA), a biological nanopore utilized for DNA and protein analysis. We used the 
steady-state Poison-Nernst-Planck (PNP) and Navier-Stokes (NS) equations to simulate the ionic fluxes and 
water flow through ClyA for a wide range of ionic strengths and bias voltages. To improve the accuracy and 
validity of our model at the nanoscale, we adapted the classical equations into a framework coined 
extended-PNP-NS (ePNP-NS). Our modifications include finite ion-size effects, ion-protein and water-protein 
interactions, self-consistent concentration dependencies for the ion diffusion coefficients, ion 
electrophoretic mobilities, solvent viscosity, solvent density and solvent relative permittivity. Our results 
show that, only when these are corrections enabled, our simplified ClyA model is able to accurately predict 
the ionic currents over a wide range of ionic strengths. We further report on the influence of both the bias 
voltage and the bulk ionic strength on the average ion concentrations inside the pore, the magnitude and 
direction of the electro-osmotic flow, and the shape of the electrostatic potential landscape inside the 
nanopore.

% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
Biosensors have been an intense field of research in the recent decades.\cite{zhan2015}
Several breatkthroughs have enabled them to play an integral role in the life sciences with
applications ranging from the monitoring of blood glucose levels\cite{chen2013} to ??. 

A particular challenge for state-of-the-art biosensors is that they need to reach molecular
sensitivities.  Nanopore based sensors solve this problem elegantly by funneling a solution
containing molecules of interest through a pore in a membrane. If the pore is approximately the
same size as the molecules, there can only ever be a single molecule inside the pore and therefore the 
response of the ion current due to the blockage of the pore gives detailed information about the molecule. 
(see Fig.~\ref{} for an illustration).

However, as the size of molecules is usually on the order of nanometer, it is not yet possible to reproducibly
build solid state nanopores\cite{} since both shape and size affect the resulting signal ion currents through
the nanopore significantly. An alternative design which has proven to be very accurate and which yields
reproducible results is to use self-assembled protein nanopores suspended on lipid bilayers.\cite{deam2016}
In fact their properties as biosensors are so desirable that they have already been commercialized for DNA
sequencing applications.\cite{???}

Despite the successes of these biological nanopores, the modeling of the sensor operation is still
in its infancy due to the multi-scale nature of the problem. On the one hand, it is necessary to
resolve the charge distribution of the protein on the atomic level requiring molecular dynamics
(MD).\cite{}  On the other hand, the size of the solvent reservoirs and thus the number of
particles is too large for a comprehensive MD simulation. More suited to the problem of the
flow of the solvent as well as the electromigration and diffusion of the ions in the solvent is a
continuum approach based on the Navier-Stokes equation (NSE) and the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations
(PNPE).\cite{}

Thus the simulation of the nanopore sits uncomfortably at the intersection of the macroscopic and the
microscopic. In this work, we want to show that it is still possible -- with remarkable accuracy --
to simulate the operation of a biological nanopore using a continuum approach based on the NSE and
PNPE. However, we will also see the limits of this approach which hint at experimentally unexplored states of
solutions within nanopores which are unlike anything that can be found in bulk solutions.

Throughout this work, we will focus on ClyA-AS type I (ClyA), a dodecameric protein nanopore evolved from
Cytolysin A of \textit{S. typhii} (\cref{fig:clya_atomistic}).\cite{soskine2013} However, the lessons learned
form the modeling can be readily transferred to other types of nanopores.

This work is organized as follows. In the section \emph{\nameref{sect:modeling_approach}} we will explain the
details of the simulation, while in the section \emph{\nameref{sect:experiment}} the experimental setup for
the verification of the model will be described. The resulting data and comparison to the model as well as a
subsequent in-depth analysis of the ion transport physics through the pore will be conducted in the section
\emph{\nameref{sect:results}}. The discussion and the conclusions follow in the remaining sections.



\section{Modeling Approach}\label{sect:modeling_approach}
Our goal is to model the protein nanopore ClyA  suspended on a lipid bilyer in a 2D-axisymmetric system in an
aqueous solution of NaCl. The lipid bilayer separates two reservoirs which can be electrically biased so that
an ion current flows through the nanopore in between the reservoirs. With no loss of generality we will assume
that the upper cis-reservoir (positive $z$-direction) is grounded, while the lower trans-reservoir is biased
with an applied potential of $\Vbias$. Figure~\ref{fig:model_geometry} illustrates the geometry of the
simulation domain.

The construction of a viable modeling approach then decomposes into two separate tasks. First, finding an
averaging scheme for the angular dependence of the charge distribution of the full 3D ClyA structure shown in
Figs.~\ref{fig:clya_atomistic_side} and \ref{fig:clya_atomistic_top} in order to accurately represent the
nanopore in a 2D-axisymemtric simulation. Second, defining a viable transport model for the ion species and
the flow of the solution through the nanopore. This includes the definition of the set of parameters
comprising mobilities, diffusion coefficients, and effective sizes of the ion species as well as the
viscosity, density, and permittivity of the solution. In particular, it is necessary to take in consideration
the nanofluidics within the pore since none of the parameters retain their bulk values in nanoscale
constrictions.



\subsection{Axially Symmetric Model of ClyA}
ClyA is a multimeric protein complex that consists of 12 (or more) identical subunits which form a 
\SI{14}{\nano\meter} long hydrophilic channel through a lipid bilayer (cf.~Figs.~\ref{fig:clya_atomistic_side}
and \ref{fig:clya_atomistic_top}). The pore cavity is lined with predominantly negatively charged residues and
can be divided in roughly two cylindrical compartments: the \cis{} lumen (\SI{5.5}{\nano\meter} diameter,
\SI{10}{\nano\meter} height) and the \trans{} constriction (\SI{3.3}{\nano\meter} diameter,
\SI{4}{\nano\meter} height). Due to this high degree of axial symmetry, we modelled ClyA as a solid,
cylindrically symmetric dielectric block, embedded within a lipid bilayer which is represented as a
\SI{2.8}{\nano\meter}-thick\cite{kucerka2011} dielectric disk  and surrounded by a spherical,
electrolyte-filled reservoir with a radius of \SI{250}{\nano\meter} 
(cf.~Figs.~\ref{fig:model_geometry} and \ref{fig:model_geometry_zoom}).\cite{lu2012,pederson2015} This approach
greatly reduces the computational cost compared to a full 3D model, while remaining sufficiently accurate.

The nanopore geometry (\cref{fig:model_concept}b) was derived directly from a full atom model of ClyA-AS --
an improved variant of ClyA evolved from the wild-type Cytolysin A from \textit{S. typhii} using directed 
evolution.\cite{soskine2013} Briefly, a homology model of ClyA-AS was constructed from the wild-type crystal 
structure (PDB: 2WCD)\cite{mueller2009} by introducing the necessary mutations in all 12 subunits 
(\cref{suppinfo:tab:clya_as_mutations}), followed by a brief energy optimization of the mutated side-chains 
with the conjugate gradient method (MODELLER, version 9.18).\cite{sali1993} We then computed the protonation 
state of titratable residue at \pH{7.5} and assigned the correct radius and partial charge to each atom of 
the model (PROPKA 3.1\cite{olsson2011} and PBD2PQR 2.1.1\cite{jurrus2018} software packages) as parametrized 
by the CHARMM36 forcefield.\cite{best2012} The atom radii were then used to compute a 3D-dimensional map of 
the nanopore's molecular surface with a probe radius of \SI{1.4}{\angstrom}, which was radially averaged 
along the z-direction with a custom-built MATLAB script to generate an approximate axisymmetric outline of 
the nanopore. To improve the quality of the final computational mesh, the resulting polygon was then 
simplified manually by removing overlapping and superfluous vertices.

Similar to the geometry, the two-dimensional charge distribution used in this model was also derived directly
from the full atom model (cf.~\cref{fig:model_concept}c). Inspired by how charges are represented in the
particle mesh Ewald (PME) method,\cite{aksimentiev2005} we computed the fixed charge distribution of the
nanopore $\scdpore(r,z)$ by assuming that an atom $i$ of partial charge $\partialcharge_{i}$ at the location
$(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ in the full 3D atomistic pore model will contribute the partial charge
$\partialcharge_{i}/2\pi\sqrt{x_i^2 + y_i^2}$ to a point $(r_i,z_i)$ in the averaged 2D-axisymmetric model.
That means we effectively spread the charge over all angles to achieve axial symmetry. 

Following that, we assume a Gaussian distribution of the space charge density of each atom $i$ around its
respective 2D-axisymmetric coordinates $(r_i,z_i)$. With the atom radius $\atomradius_{i}$ and the sharpness
factor $\sigma = \num{0.5}$, we find for the 2D space charge density
\begin{align}
\label{eq:scdpore}
\scdpore(r,z) = \displaystyle\sum_{i} \dfrac{\echarge\partialcharge_{i}}{\pi(\stdev\atomradius_{i})^2} 
\exp{\left(-\dfrac{(r-r_i)^2 + (z-z_i)^2}{(\stdev\atomradius_{i})^2}\right)}
\end{align}
where $\echarge$ is the elementary charge. To embed $\scdpore$ with sufficient detail yet efficiently
into a numeric solver, the spatial coordinates are discretized with a grid spacing of \SI{0.005}{\nano\meter}
in the domain of $\scdpore$ and precomputed values are used during the solver runtime.

%Instead of explicitly selecting a few amino acids as \emph{key} charged
%residues, our method includes all partial charges and is hence more comprehensive. Furthermore, since it can
%be applied as a single boundary condition over the entire model, it does not require the definition of
%additional geometric features to hold the charges.

% Grid: r from 0 to 70 A, res = 0.05 A 
% 		z from -35 to 135 A, res = 0.05 A
% Sigma = 0.5



\subsection{Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes equations}
To describe the ion and water transport mechanisms within ClyA, we created a computational model of the fluid
based on a set of well-known partial-differential equations (PDEs) called the coupled
Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes (PNP-NS) equations. 

While these equations have proven to be excellent tool for studying ion and water transport in both 
solid-state\cite{daiguji2004,lu2012,chaudhry2014,rempfer2016,lin2016} and biological 
nanopores,\cite{eisenberg1996,simakov2010,pederson2015} the underlying continuum assumption does not hold at 
the nanoscale under all circumstances, particularly at material interfaces\cite{vo2016} and in regions of 
high charge density.\cite{corry2000} To address these concerns and to improve the accuracy of our model, we 
propose a modified version of these equations, that we will refer to as extended PNP-NS (ePNP-NS), which takes
into account the finite size of the ions\cite{borukhov1997,lu2011} and the reduction of ion and water mobility
near protein interfaces.\cite{makarov1998, pronk2013} Because the diffusion coefficient, mobility, viscosity,
density\cite{} and relative permittivity\cite{gavish2016} often deviate significantly from the traditional
`infinite dilution' values at experimentally relevant concentrations, we implemented a self-consistent
dependency on the average ion concentration for all these parameters.

In this section we will start by describing the classical PNP-NS equations and their boundary conditions,
followed by a description of ePNP-NS framework that includes several additions and corrections which enhance
their physical accuracy at nanoscale and their ability to predict ionic currents at high ionic strengths.

Due to the complexity of the set of self-consistent equations, we chose to solve the system using the finite
element method (FEM) as provided by the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics (version 5.3,
\href{www.comsol.com}{www.comsol.com}).

\subsubsection{Poisson Equation} 
The Poisson equation (PE) relates the electrostatic potential to the charges present in a system 
and is given by 
\begin{align} 
\label{eq:poisson}
\nabla\cdot\left(\absperm\relperm \nabla\potential\right) = - \scdpore - \scdion,
\end{align}
with $\potential$ the electric potential, $\absperm=\SI{8.85419e-12}{\farad\per\meter}$ the vacuum
permittivity, and $\relperm$ the local relative permittivity of the medium listed in
\cref{tab:pnpns_parameters}. The total charge density on the right hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:poisson}
consists of a fixed contribution $\scdpore$ due to charges of the nanopore of Eq.~\eqref{eq:scdpore}, and an ion
concentration dependent component $\scdion$ caused by local non-electroneutralities in the fluid
(cf.~Eq.~\eqref{eq:scdion}).

Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied to the boundaries of the \cis{} and \trans{} reservoirs. The
potential at the \cis{} boundary is set to $\potential = 0$ whereas at the \trans{} boundary it is set to
$\potential = \Vbias$. Neumann boundary conditions apply at the bilayer-boundary interface.

\end{table}


\subsubsection{Nernst-Planck Equation}
The Nernst-Plack equation (NPE) describes the flux $\flux_{i}$ of each ion species $i$ under the influence of
a chemical gradient (diffusion), a non-zero electrical field (electromigration) and a laminar fluid flow
(convection) and is given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:nernst-planck}
\nabla\cdot\flux_{i} = \nabla\cdot\left( -\diffusion_{i}\nabla\concentration_{i} - 
\chargen_{i}\mobility_{i}\concentration_{i}\nabla\potential \right)
+\velocity\cdot\nabla\concentration_{i} = 0
\end{align}
with $\concentration_{i}$ the concentration, $\diffusion_{i}$ the diffusion coefficient, $\chargen_{i}$ the 
charge number, $\mobility_{i}$ the electrophoretic mobility, and $\velocity$ the fluid velocity. The relevant
parameters for \ce{NaCl} are listed in \cref{tab:pnpns_parameters}.
The NPE is coupled to the PE by the electric potential $\potential$ and the ion space charge density
\begin{align} 
\label{eq:scdion}
\scdion = \faraday\displaystyle\sum_{i}\chargen_{i}\concentration_{i},
\end{align}
where $\faraday= \SI{96485.33}{\coulomb\per\mole}$ is Faraday's constant.

The ion concentration at both reservoir boundaries was fixed using a Dirichlet boundary condition 
($\concentration_i = \concentration_\textrm{bulk}$). At the fluid-protein and fluid-bilayer interface Neumann
boundary conditions apply, i.e.~no current can flow in or out of the protein or the bilayer.



\subsubsection{Navier-Stokes Equation} 
The Navier-Stokes equation (NSE) for laminar flow of an incompressible fluid will be used to describe the
fluid velocity field $\velocity$. It is given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:navier-stokes}
\density\left(\velocity\cdot\nabla\right)\velocity = \nabla\cdot\left[-\pressure\identity + 
\viscosity\left(\nabla\velocity + \left(\nabla\velocity\right)^{\rm T}\right)\right]+\volumeforce,
\end{align}
together with the continuity equation
\begin{align}
\label{eq:navier-stokes-contin}
\density\nabla\cdot\left(\velocity\right) = 0,
\end{align}
where $\density$ and $\viscosity$ are the fluid's density and dynamic viscosity, respectively. For \ce{NaCl}
the parameters are given in \cref{tab:pnpns_parameters}. The driving force that generates the electro-osmotic
flow 
\begin{align}
\volumeforce = \echarge\avogadro\scdion\efield,
\end{align}
acts on all fluid elements with a non-zero net space charge density $\scdion$ and electrical field $\efield$.

At the boundaries of the \cis{} and \trans{} reservoirs, we use open boundary conditions with no normal stress
($\left[-\pressure\identity + \viscosity\left(\nabla\velocity + \left(\nabla\velocity\right)^{\rm
T}\right)\right]\normvec = 0$), effectively mimicking an endless reservoir. On the nanopore and bilayer
surface we applied a no-slip ($\vec{\velocity} = 0$) boundary condition.



\subsection{Extended PNP-NS Equations}
The traditional PNP-NS equations as described above cannot capture the transport accurately within fluids of
strongly varying concentrations or when the concentration is close to saturation or in nanoscale constrictions
when wall effects are non-negligible. However, the simulation of transport of ions through protein nanopores
happens precisely under these conditions and therefore we include the three following effects fully
self-consistently:
\begin{itemize}
    \item concentration dependent diffusion, mobility, viscosity, density an relative permittivity;
    \item wall-distance dependent diffusion, mobility and viscosity; and
    \item inclusion of a finite ion size term in the NPE. 
\end{itemize}
In the remainder of this work, we will refer to the model containing these effects as extended PNP-NS
(ePNP-NS). 

Concentration and wall-distance dependent parameters can be included by substitution of experimentally
determined functions as
\begin{align}
\diffusion_{i}		&= \left[ \diffusion_{i}^c(\dconc) \times \diffusion_{i}^w\left(\dwall\right) \right] 
    \times \SI{e-9}{\square\meter\per\second}, \label{eq:diffusion} \\
\mobility_{i}  		&= \left[ \mobility_{i}^c(\dconc) \times \mobility_{i}^w\left(\dwall\right) \right] 
    \times \SI{e-8}{\square\meter\per\second\per\volt}, \label{eq:mobility}\\
\viscosity     		&= \left[ \viscosity^c(\dconc) \times \viscosity^w\left(\dwall\right)\right] 
    \times \SI{e-4}{\pascal\second}, \label{eq:viscosity}\\
\density 	   		&= \density(\dconc) \times\SI{e3}{\kg\per\cubic\meter}, \label{eq:density}\\
\permittivity_{f} 	&= \permittivity_{f}(\dconc),
    \label{eq:permittivity}
\end{align}
where the superscripts $c$ and $w$ indicate the concentration and wall-distance dependent functions,
respectively, $\dconc = \avionconc/\SI{1}{\Molar}$ and $\dwall = \walldistance/\SI{1}{\nano\meter}$ represent
the dimensionless average ion concentration and dimensionless distance from the nanopore wall, respectively.
For the present work, the definition of these functions is given in \cref{tab:corrections_equations}, their
fits to the experimental data are shown in \cref{suppinfo:fig:corrections}, and the resulting fitting
parameters are listed in \cref{suppinfo:tab:corrections_parameters}.

\input{tab_corrections_equations.tex}

To obtain the concentration-dependent ionic mobility  $\mobility^c_{i}$ from fitted functions, it must first
be derived from the salt's molar conductivity $\molarconductivity$ and the ion's transport number
$\transportn_{i}$ before it can be fitted\cite{aburto2013I}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:conductivity-to-mobility}
\mobility_{i}(\concentration) = \frac{\specmolarconductivity_{i}(\concentration)}{\chargen_{i}\faraday} 
\quad\text{with}\quad \specmolarconductivity_{i}(\concentration) = \molarconductivity(\concentration) 
\transportn_{i}(\concentration),
\end{align}
where $\specmolarconductivity_{i}(\concentration)$ is the specific molar conductivity of ion $i$.


Note that all parameters simply depend on the average concentration rather than on the concentration of each
species. This is because measurements are usually performed in bulk solutions where the concentrations of the
ions are the same. However, at interfaces and within nanopores the concentrations may differ wildly. But due
to the lack of experimental data for these conditions, we need to resort to extrapolation -- which is simply
the average. Nevertheless, later on in Sect.~\ref{}, we will see that the current concentration and dependent
functions will lead to an excellent fit to experimental data in all but the most extreme cases, justifying our
choice a posteriori.

The diffusivity of ions or small molecules like water depends heavily on their proximity to large molecules
such as proteins or DNA.\cite{makarov1998} Since these effects happen only for distances of less than about 
a nanometer, they can usually be neglected. However, in small nanopores (\SI{\le 5}{\nano\meter}
radius), they comprise a significant fraction of the total nanopore radius and hence must be taken into
account.\cite{simakov2010,pederson2015}  The wall-distance dependent diffusion coefficients 
$\diffusion_{i}^w(\dwall)$ and mobilities $\mobility_{i}^w(\dwall)$ and their respective fitting parameters 
were directly adapted from Ref.~\citenum{simakov2010}. The wall-distance dependent viscosity
$\viscosity^w(\dwall)$ was fitted as a logistic function to the average of the inverse viscosities from
Ref.~\citenum{pronk2013} where the hydrodynamic radius of the proteins was interpreted as the position of the
wall (cf.~\cref{fig:}).


Because the PNP equations do not take the size of the ions into account, they tend to overscreen locations 
with high charge densities resulting in unrealistically high ion concentrations.\cite{corry2000} This problem 
can be addressed by the addition of a nonlinear flux term to the NPE that poses an upper limit to the 
concentration. We opted for the size-modified PNP (SMPNP) framework developed by Lu and Zhou,\cite{lu2011}
\begin{align}
\nabla\cdot\flux_{i} = \nabla\cdot\left(
	- \diffusion_{i}\nabla\concentration_{i}
	- \chargen_{i}\mobility_{i}\concentration_{i}\nabla\potential 
	- \frac{k_{i}\concentration_{i} \displaystyle\sum_{l} \ionsize_{l}^3 \nabla \concentration_{l}}{1 - 
	\displaystyle\sum_{l} \avogadro \ionsize_{l}^3 \concentration_{l}}\right)
  +\velocity\cdot\nabla\concentration_{i} = 0
	\quad\text{with}\quad k_{i}=\ionsize_{i}^3/\ionsize_{0}^3
\end{align}
where $\ionsize_{i}$ and $\ionsize_{0}$ represent the maximum packing radius in a cubic lattice for ions and 
solvent molecules, respectively. The radii were set to \SI{0.5}{\nano\meter} for both \ce{Na+} and \ce{Cl-} 
and to \SI{0.311}{\nano\meter} for water, corresponding to maximum concentrations of \SI{13.3}{\Molar} and 
\SI{55.2}{\Molar}, respectively.

\section{Results}\label{sect:results}
In this section, we start by our investigating the concentration and voltage dependencies of the ion 
transport through ClyA in terms of conductance, rectification and selectivity. The values of the former two 
parameters were also measured experimentally and hence these are used to benchmark the performance of our 
model. Next, we will describe in detail several parameters that are of great interest, but cannot be readily 
determined experimentally, namely the concentration of cations and anions inside the pore, the distribution 
of the electrostatic potential and the properties of the electro-osmotic flow. 

% Key message: The extensions made to the PNP-NS equations are necessary to accurately predict the ionic 
%current flowing through ClyA over a wide range of salt concentrations and bias voltages
\subsection{Transport of ions through ClyA}
The ionic current flowing through a nanopore is determined by both characteristics of the pore itself (i.e., 
its shape, size and electrostatics), and by the properties of the electrolyte that surrounds it (i.e., 
ion diffusion coefficients, ion electrophoretic mobilities, solvent viscosity, density and relative 
permittivity). To reliably predict the ionic current, our nanopore simulation should thus not only contain an 
accurate geometry and charge distribution, it must also accurately portrait all relevant transport phenomena 
(i.e., diffusion, electromigration and convection). These processes often depend strongly on the local 
conditions (i.e. temperature, concentration, etc.) and hence they should also be parameterized with locally 
relevant values. This becomes particularly important for nanopores, since the small scales often result in 
conditions that differ significantly from those in the bulk.

\paragraph{Ionic current.}
To investigate the importance of these localized effects, we performed steady-state simulations over a wide 
range of bulk salt concentrations (from 0.005 to 5~M) and bias voltages using both the classical PNP-NS and 
our extended PNP-NS (ePNP-NS) equations. To validate our model, we recorded single-channel current-voltage 
(IV) curves of ClyA for a representative subset concentrations (0.05, 0.15, 0.5, 1 and 3~M), the results of 
which were plotted together with simulations in \cref{fig:current-voltage_curves}.
From the simulation, the total ionic current $\currentsim$ was obtained using
\begin{equation}
  \currentsim = \faraday\int_{S}\left(\displaystyle\sum_{i}            
                \chargen_{i}\normvec\cdot\vec{\flux_{i}}\right)dS  
\end{equation}
with $\chargen_{i}$ the charge number and $\vec{\flux_{i}}$ the total flux of each ion $i$ across the 
reservoir boundary $S$. $\faraday$ is the Faraday constant (\SI{96.485}{\coulomb\per\mole}) and $\normvec$ is 
the normal vector.
Over the entire investigated concentration range, the IVs from the ePNP-NS model closely correspond to the 
measured values ($<5\%$ error). In contrast, the PNP-NS equations significantly overestimates the ionic 
current for all measured concentrations. Interestingly, while the PNP-NS model performs the worst at high 
salt concentrations -- as is to be expected --, for ePNP-NS the error is largest in at lower concentrations, 
particularly at positive bias voltages. The corrections that contribute the most to the current prediction 
are the concentration and wall-distance dependencies of the ion mobilities and diffusion coefficients.

\paragraph{Ionic conductance.}
To further investigate the ionic transport, we computed the the ionic conductance $\conductance$ from the IV 
data
\begin{equation}
  \conductance = \displaystyle\frac{\current}{\varpotential}
\end{equation}
and the resulting concentration-voltage landscape can be found in \cref{fig:conductance_contourmap_epnp}. The 
straight slopes of the concentration-conductivity log-log plot at -150~mV exhibits a clear `kink' at 
$\approx$0.15~M, suggesting the presence of two different conductance regimes. Fitting of the data at low 
(0.005 to 0.05~M) and high concentrations (0.3 to 1.5~M) with a simple power law function 
($\conductance(\concentration)=a e^{b \concentration}$) yielded exponents of 
$b=\SI{0.498\pm0.004}{\per\Molar}$ and $b=\SI{1.000\pm0.016}{\per\Molar}$, respectively. These perfect 
square-root and linear dependencies are less apparent at high positive bias voltages, however, as fitting 
yielded exponents of $b=\SI{0.614\pm0.009}{\per\Molar}$ and $b=\SI{0.787\pm0.001}{\per\Molar}$ for low and 
high concentrations, respectively. Hence, while there are clearly two distinct ion transport modes at high 
negative bias voltages, the converging exponents at high positive voltages suggest a `hybrid' mode with 
characteristics of both regimes.

\paragraph{Ionic current rectification.}
A nanopore is said to exhibit ionic current rectification (ICR) when the conductance for a given bias 
voltage, the conductance is higher when it is applied to one side of the nanopore compared to the other.
ICR is a phenomenon often observed in nanopores that are both charged and contain a degree of geometrical 
asymmetry along the central axis of the pore. With it's high negative charge (\SI{-72}{\elementarycharge} at 
\pH{7.5}) and different \textit{cis} ($\approx$3.3~nm) and \textit{trans} ($\approx$5.5~nm) entry diameters, 
ClyA fulfils both conditions and hence exhibits a strong degree of rectification.
Here, we define the ICR as
\begin{equation}
  \icr(\varpotential) = \displaystyle\frac{\conductance(+\varpotential)}{\conductance(-\varpotential)}
\end{equation}
i.e. the ratio between the conductance of the pore at positive and negative bias voltages of equal magnitude. 
The dependency of $\icr$

While $\icr$ rises linearly with the applied bias voltage, the concentration dependency exhibits a maximum 
value of 1.28 for the experiment
The concentration dependence is not as trivial, and hence we plotted its values at \SI{100}{\milli\volt} vs. 
the bulk concentration in \cref{fig:conductance_rectification_contourmap_epnp}
Due to the high degree of electrostatic screening, the ICR is close to unity (1.02) , but rises rapidly when ,The rectification rises concentration dependency is not so trivial, however, as it appears to show a maximum value of 1.28 at \SI{150}{\milli\Molar},
and decreasing for both lower and higher salt concentrations.
The simulation shows the
