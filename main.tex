\begin{abstract}
Biological nanopores have become valuable tools for the detection and analysis of molecules and the 
sequencing of nucleic acids at the single-molecule level. However, the physical understanding of the 
transport of ions and water across small nanopores and the scale the electrophoretic forces inside the 
nanopore is still superficial. From this perspective, we have built a detailed, 2D-axisymmetric continuum 
model of Cytolysin A (ClyA), a biological nanopore utilized for DNA and protein analysis. We used the 
steady-state Poison-Nernst-Planck (PNP) and Navier-Stokes (NS) equations to simulate the ionic fluxes and 
water flow through ClyA for a wide range of ionic strengths and bias voltages. To improve the accuracy and 
validity of our model at the nanoscale, we adapted the classical equations into a framework coined 
extended-PNP-NS (ePNP-NS). Our modifications include finite ion-size effects, ion-protein and water-protein 
interactions, self-consistent concentration dependencies for the ion diffusion coefficients, ion 
electrophoretic mobilities, solvent viscosity, solvent density and solvent relative permittivity. Our results 
show that, only when these are corrections enabled, our simplified ClyA model is able to accurately predict 
the ionic currents over a wide range of ionic strengths. We further report on the influence of both the bias 
voltage and the bulk ionic strength on the average ion concentrations inside the pore, the magnitude and 
direction of the electro-osmotic flow, and the shape of the electrostatic potential landscape inside the 
nanopore.

% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
Biosensors have been an intense field of research in the recent decades~\cite{zhan2015}. 
Several breatkthroughs have enabled them to play integral role in the life sciences with
applications ranging from the monitoring of blood glucose levels~\cite{chen2013} to ??. 

A particular challenge for state-of-the-art biosensors is that they need to reach molecular
sensitivities.  Nanopore based sensors solve this problem elegantly by funneling a solution
containing molecules of interest through a pore in a membrane. If the pore is approximately the
same size as the molecules, there can only ever be a single molecule inside the pore. The response
of the ion current shift due to the blockage of the pore therefore achieves molecular sensitivity
(see Fig.~\ref{} for an illustration).

However, as the size of molecules is usually on the order of nanometer, it is not yet possible to
reproducibly build solid state nanopores~\cite{} since both shape and size affect the resulting
signal ion currents through the nanopore significantly. An alternative design is to self-assembled
protein nanopores suspended on lipid bilayers have proven to be very accurate and to yield
reproducible results~\cite{deam2016}. In fact their properties as biosensors are so desirable that
they have already been commercialized for DNA sequencing applications~\cite{}. 

Despite the successes of these biological nanopores, the modeling of the sensor operation is still
in its infancy due to the multi-scale nature of the problem. On the one hand, it is necessary to
resolve the charge distribution of the protein on the atomic level requiring molecular dynamics
(MD)~\cite{}.  On the other hand, the size of the solvent reservoirs and thus the number of
particles is too large to for a comprehensive MD simulation. More suited to the problem of the
flow of the solvent as well as the electromigration and diffusion of the ions in the solvent is a
continuum approach based on the Navier-Stokes equation (NSE) and the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations
(PNPE)~\cite{}.

Thus the simulation of the nanopore sits awkwardly at the intersection of macroscopic and the
microscopic. In this work, we want to show that it is still possible -- with remarkable accuracy --
to simulate the operation of a biological nanopore using a continuum approach based on the NSE and
PNPE. However, we will also see the limits of this approach which hint at the experimentally
unexplored states of solutions within nanopores which are unlike anything that can be found in bulk
solutions.

\end{enumerate}

This paper shows that a complete model of a biological nanopore suspended on a lipid bilayer is feasible and we will show that it can match experimental results.

In this work we used ClyA-AS type I (ClyA), a dodecameric protein nanopore evolved from Cytolysin A of \textit{S. typhii} to be more experimentally stable and consistent (\cref{fig:clya_atomistic}).\cite{soskine2013}

\section{Theory}
To improve our understanding of the ion and water transport mechanisms within ClyA, we created a 
computational model of the nanopore based on a set of well-known partial-differential equations (PDEs) called 
the coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes (PNP-NS) equations. Due to ClyA's complexity, a meaningful 
analytical solution is intractable and must hence be approximated numerically. We opted for the finite 
element method (FEM) as implemented in the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics (version 5.3, 
\href{www.comsol.com}{www.comsol.com}).

While these equations have proven to be excellent tool for studying ion and water transport in both 
solid-state\cite{daiguji2004,lu2012,chaudhry2014,rempfer2016,lin2016} and biological 
nanopores,\cite{eisenberg1996,simakov2010,pederson2015} the underlying continuum assumption does not hold at 
the nanoscale under all circumstances, particularly at material interfaces\cite{vo2016} and in regions of 
high charge density.\cite{corry2000} To address these concerns and to improve the accuracy of our model, we 
propose a modified version of these equations, coined extended PNP-NS (ePNP-NS), which take into account 
finite size of the ions\cite{borukhov1997,lu2011} and the reduction of ion and water mobility near protein 
interfaces.\cite{makarov1998, pronk2013} Because the diffusion coefficient, mobility, viscosity, 
density\cite{} and relative permittivity\cite{gavish2016} often deviate significantly from the traditional 
`infinite dilution' values at experimentally relevant concentrations, we implemented a self-consistent 
dependency on the average ion concentration for all these parameters.

In the following sections, we will begin by describing a 2D-axisymmetric model of the geometry and charge 
distribution of the ClyA, followed by an an outline of the classical PNP-NS equations and finally we will 
introduce in detail the nanoscale corrections and concentration dependencies of the ePNP-NS framework.

\subsection{Axially Symmetric Model of ClyA.}

ClyA is a multimeric protein complex that consists of 12 (or more) identical subunits which form a 
\SI{14}{\nano\meter} long hydrophilic channel through a lipid bilayer. The pore cavity is lined with 
predominantly negatively charged residues can be divided in roughly two cylindrical compartments: the 
\textit{cis} lumen (\SI{5.5}{\nano\meter} diameter, \SI{10}{\nano\meter} height) and the \textit{trans} 
constriction (\SI{3.3}{\nano\meter} diameter, \SI{4}{\nano\meter} height). Due to this high degree of axial 
symmetry, we modelled ClyA as a solid, cylindrically symmetric dielectric block, embedded within a lipid 
membrane represented as a \SI{2.8}{\nano\meter}-thick\cite{kucerka2011} dielectric disk  and surrounded by a 
spherical, electrolyte-filled reservoir with a radius of \SI{250}{\nano\meter} 
(\cref{fig:model_concept}a).\cite{lu2012,pederson2015} This approach greatly reduces the computational cost 
compared to a full 3D model, while still retaining sufficient accuracy to provide relevant results. 

\paragraph{Nanopore geometry.}
The nanopore geometry (\cref{fig:model_concept}b) was derived directly from a full atom model of ClyA-AS,
an improved variant of ClyA evolved from the wild-type Cytolysin A from \textit{S. typhii} using directed 
evolution.\cite{soskine2013} Briefly, a homology model of ClyA-AS was constructed from the wild-type crystal 
structure (PDB: 2WCD)\cite{mueller2009} by introducing the necessary mutations in all 12 subunits 
(\cref{suppinfo:tab:clya_as_mutations}), followed by a brief energy optimization of the mutated side-chains 
with the conjugate gradient method (MODELLER, version 9.18).\cite{sali1993} We then computed the protonation 
state of titratable residue at \pH{7.5} and assigned the correct a radius and partial charge to each atom of 
the model (PROPKA 3.1\cite{olsson2011} and PBD2PQR 2.1.1\cite{jurrus2018} software packages) as parametrized 
by the CHARMM36 forcefield.\cite{best2012} The atom radii were then used to compute a 3D-dimensional map of 
the nanopore's molecular surface with a probe radius of \SI{1.4}{\angstrom}, which was radially averaged 
along the z-direction with a custom-built MATLAB script to generate an approximate axisymmetric outline of 
the nanopore. To improve the quality of the final computational mesh, the resulting polygon was then 
simplified manually by removing overlapping and superfluous vertices.

\paragraph{Nanopore fixed charge density.}
Similar to the geometry, the two-dimensional charge distribution used in this model was also derived directly 
from the full atom model (\cref{fig:model_concept}c). Inspired by how charges are represented in the particle 
mesh Ewald (PME) method,\cite{aksimentiev2005} we computed the fixed charge distribution of the nanopore 
$\scdpore(r,z)$ by projecting the partial charge $\partialcharge_{i}$ of each atom $i$ on a two-dimensional 
grid (\SI{0.005}{\nano\meter} resolution) with a Gaussian-like function:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:scdpore}
\scdpore(r,z) = \displaystyle\sum_{i} \dfrac{\echarge\partialcharge_{i}}{\pi(\stdev\atomradius_{i})^2} 
\exp{\left(-\dfrac{(r-r_i)^2 + (z-z_i)^2}{(\stdev\atomradius_{i})^2}\right)}
\end{align}
with $\echarge$ the elementary charge, $\atomradius_{i}$ the atom radius, $\sigma$ a sharpness factor (set to 0.5) and
$r_i = \sqrt{x_i^2+y_i^2}$ and $z_i$ the distance of the atom from the central axis and the height along the 
central axis, respectively. Instead of explicitly selecting a few amino acids as `key' charged residues, our 
method includes all partial charges and is hence more comprehensive. Furthermore, since it can be applied as 
a single boundary condition over the entire model, it does not require the definition of additional geometric 
features to hold the charges.

\subsection{Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes (PNP-NS) equations}

In this section we will start by describing the classical PNP-NS equations and their boundary conditions,
followed by a description of the extended-PNP-NS (ePNP-NS) framework that includes a several additions and 
corrections which enhance their physical accuracy at nanoscale and their ability to predict ionic currents at 
high ionic strengths.

\paragraph{Poisson's equation (PE)} relates the electrostatic potential to the charges present in a system 
and is given by 
\begin{align} 
\label{eq:poisson}
\nabla\cdot\left(\absperm\relperm \nabla\potential\right) = \scdpore + \scdion,
\end{align}
with $\potential$ the electric potential, $\absperm$ the vacuum permittivity 
(\SI{8.85419e-12}{\farad\per\meter}) and $\relperm$ the local relative permittivity. The total charge density 
on the right hand side of \cref{eq:poisson} consists of a fixed contribution $\scdpore$ due to charges of 
nanopore itself (\cref{eq:scdpore}), and a ion concentration dependent component $\scdion$ caused by local 
non-electroneutralities in the fluid (\cref{eq:scdion}).

The Nernst-Plack equation (NPE) describes the flux $\flux_{i}$ of each ion $i$ under the influence of a 
chemical gradient (diffusion), a non-zero electrical field (electromigration) and a laminar fluid flow 
(convection) and is given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:nernst-planck}
\nabla\cdot\flux_{i} = \nabla\cdot\left( -\diffusion_{i}\nabla\concentration_{i} - 
\chargen_{i}\mobility_{i}\concentration_{i}\nabla\potential +\velocity\concentration_{i}\right) = 0
\end{align}
with $\concentration_{i}$ the concentration, $\diffusion_{i}$ the diffusion coefficient, $\chargen_{i}$ the 
charge number, $\mobility_{i}$ the electrophoretic mobility, and $\velocity$ the fluid velocity.
The NPE is coupled to the PE by using the electric potential $\potential$ and the ion space charge density
\begin{align} 
\label{eq:scdion}
\scdion = \faraday\displaystyle\sum_{i}\chargen_{i}\concentration_{i},
\end{align}
where $\faraday$ is Faraday's constant (\SI{96485.33}{\coulomb\per\mole}).

\paragraph{The Navier-Stokes equation (NSE)} describes the fluid velocity $\velocity$ and is given  
\begin{align}
\label{eq:navier-stokes}
\density\left(\velocity\cdot\nabla\right)\velocity = \nabla\cdot\left[-\pressure\identity + 
\viscosity\left(\nabla\velocity + \left(\nabla\velocity\right)^{\rm T}\right)\right]+\volumeforce,
\end{align}
together with the continuity equation
\begin{align}
\label{eq:navier-stokes-contin}
\density\nabla\cdot\left(\velocity\right) = 0,
\end{align}
where $\density$ and $\viscosity$ are the fluid's density and dynamic viscosity, respectively. 
The driving force that generates the electro-osmotic flow 
\begin{align}
\volumeforce = \echarge\avogadro\scdion\efield,
\end{align}
acts on all fluid elements with a non-zero $\scdion$ and electrical field $\efield$.

\paragraph{Parameters for PNP-NS.}
The system temperature was chosen to be \SI{298.15}{\kelvin}.
The relative permittivities were set to $\permittivity_p = 20$ for the pore\cite{li2013},$\permittivity_m = 
3.2$ for the membrane\cite{gramse2013} and $\permittivity_w = 78.15$ for the fluid reservoir.
Other properties were set at those for an \ce{NaCl} solution in water at infinite dilution, with
fluid density $\density = \SI{997}{\kilogram\per\cubic\meter}$;  dynamic viscosity $\viscosity = 
\SI{8.904e-4}{\pascal\second}$;
charge numbers $\chargen_{\ce{Na+}} = +1$ and $\chargen_{\ce{Cl-}} = -1$;
diffusion coefficients $\diffusion_{\ce{Na+}} = \SI{1.334e-9}{\square\meter\per\second}$ and 
$\diffusion_{\ce{Cl-}} = \SI{2.032e-9}{\square\meter\per\second}$;
and mobilities $\mobility_{\ce{Na+}} = \SI{5.192e-4}{\square\meter\per\second\per\volt}$ and 
$\mobility_{\ce{Cl-}} = \SI{7.909e-4}{\square\meter\per\second\per\volt}$.

\paragraph{Boundary conditions.}
The ion concentration at both reservoir boundaries was fixed using a Dirichlet boundary condition 
($\concentration_i = \concentration_\textrm{bulk}$) 
and the free in-and outflow of fluid ensured by an open boundary condition with no normal stress
($\left[-\pressure\identity + \viscosity\left(\nabla\velocity + \left(\nabla\velocity\right)^{\rm 
T}\right)\right]\normvec = 0$), effectively mimicking an endless reservoir. The bias voltage was applied to 
the \textit{trans} boundary ($\potential = \varpotential_\textrm{bias}$), while the \textit{cis} boundary was 
grounded ($\potential = 0$). On the nanopore and bilayer surface we applied a no-slip ($\vec{\velocity} = 0$) 
and no flux ($-\normvec\cdot\vec{\flux}_i = 0$) boundary conditions.

\subsection{Extended PNP-NS (ePNP-NS) equations}
Because the classical PNP-NS equations do not include any interactions between components in the system,
their applicability is in principle limited to transport phenomena at very low ionic strengths.
To mitigate these issues, we implemented three self-consistent corrections to the classical PNP-NS equations:
(1) concentration dependent diffusion, mobility, viscosity, density an relative permittivity;
(2) wall-distance dependent diffusion, mobility and viscosity; and
(3) inclusion of a finite ion size term to the NPE. 

\paragraph{Concentration dependent properties.}
The concentration dependent ion self-diffusion coefficients $\diffusion_{i}^1(\dconc)$, cation transport 
number $\transportn_{i}(\dconc)$, viscosity $\viscosity^1(\dconc)$, density $\density(\dconc)$ and relative 
permittivity $\permittivity_{w}(\dconc)$ could be fitted directly the experimental data with the empirical 
equations given in \cref{tab:corrections_equations}. Here $\dconc = \avionconc/\SI{1}{\Molar}$ is a 
dimensionless value that represents the average ion concentration. The concentration-dependent ionic mobility 
$\mobility^1_{i}$ must first be derived from the salt's molar conductivity $\molarconductivity$ and the ion's 
transport number $\transportn_{i}$ before it can be fitted\cite{aburto2013I}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:conductivity-to-mobility}
\mobility_{i}(\concentration) = \frac{\specmolarconductivity_{i}(\concentration)}{\chargen_{i}\faraday} 
\quad\text{with}\quad \specmolarconductivity_{i}(\concentration) = \molarconductivity(\concentration) 
\transportn_{i}(\concentration),
\end{align}
where $\specmolarconductivity_{i}(\concentration)$ is the specific molar conductivity of ion $i$.

All fitting functions can be found in \cref{tab:corrections_equations}, their fitting coefficients in 
\cref{suppinfo:tab:corrections_parameters} and a plot of the fits to the experimental data in 
\cref{suppinfo:fig:corrections}.

\paragraph{Wall-distance corrections.}
The diffusivity of small molecules such ions or water depends heavily on their proximity, i.e. within 
\SI{1.0}{\nano\meter} distance, to large molecules such as proteins or DNA.\cite{makarov1998} In small 
nanopores (\SI{\le 5}{\nano\meter} radius), these effects encompass a significant fraction of the total 
nanopore radius, and hence cannot be neglected.\cite{simakov2010,pederson2015} For the wall-distance 
dependent diffusion coefficients $\diffusion_{i}^2(\dwall)$ and mobilities 
$\mobility_{i}^2(\dwall)$ we used Eq.~11 from ref.~\citenum{simakov2010} 
and the fitting parameters obtained by the authors. For the wall-distance dependent viscosity 
$\viscosity^2(\dwall)$, we first offset the inverse viscosity data from Figure~4 of ref.~\citenum{pronk2013} 
by each proteins' respective hydrodynamic radius, which we assume to be a good approximation of the average 
protein radius, and fitted all the resulting data points with a logistic function.

\paragraph{Finite ion-size effects.}
Because the PNP equations do not take the size of the ions into account, they tend to overscreen locations 
with high charge densities resulting in unrealistically high ion concentrations.\cite{corry2000} This problem 
can be addressed by the addition of a nonlinear flux term to the NPE that poses an upper limit to the 
concentration. We opted for the size-modified PNP (SMPNP) framework developed by Lu and Zhou,\cite{lu2011}
\begin{align}
\nabla\cdot\flux_{i} = \nabla\cdot\left(
	- \diffusion_{i}\nabla\concentration_{i}
	- \chargen_{i}\mobility_{i}\concentration_{i}\nabla\potential 
	- \frac{k_{i}\concentration_{i} \displaystyle\sum_{l} \ionsize_{l}^3 \nabla \concentration_{l}}{1 - \displaystyle\sum_{l} \avogadro \ionsize_{l}^3 \concentration_{l}}
	+ \velocity\concentration_{i}\right)
	\quad\text{with}\quad k_{i}=\ionsize_{i}^3/\ionsize_{0}^3
\end{align}
where $\ionsize_{i}$ and $\ionsize_{0}$ represent the maximum packing radius in a cubic lattice for ions and 
solvent molecules, respectively. The radii were set to \SI{0.5}{\nano\meter} for both \ce{Na+} and \ce{Cl-} 
and to \SI{0.311}{\nano\meter} for water, corresponding to maximum concentrations of \SI{13.3}{\Molar} and 
\SI{55.2}{\Molar}, respectively. 

\paragraph{The final ePNP-NS model.}
We obtain the final ePNP-NS model by substituting the following, traditionally constant, parameters of the 
PNP-NS equations by the concentration- and distance-dependent functions
\begin{align}
\diffusion_{i}		&= \left[ \diffusion_{i}^1(\dconc) \times \diffusion_{i}^2(\dwall) \right] \times \SI{e-9}{\square\meter\per\second}, \\
\mobility_{i}  		&= \left[ \mobility_{i}^1(\dconc) \times \mobility_{i}^2(\dwall) \right] \times \SI{e-8}{\square\meter\per\second\per\volt}, \\
\viscosity     		&= \left[ \viscosity^1(\dconc) \times \viscosity^2(\dwall)\right] \times \SI{e-4}{\pascal\second}, \\
\density 	   		&= \density(\dconc) \times\SI{e3}{\kg\per\cubic\meter} \quad\text{and}, \\
\permittivity_{w} 	&= \permittivity_{w}(\dconc)
\end{align}
where $\dconc = \avionconc/\SI{1}{\Molar}$ and $\dwall = \walldistance/\SI{1}{\nano\meter}$ represent the 
dimensionless average ion concentration and dimensionless distance from the nanopore wall, respectively.
The detailed equations behind these functions are listed in \cref{tab:corrections_equations}, their fits to 
the experimental data are shown in \cref{suppinfo:fig:corrections} and the resulting fitting parameters are 
listed in \cref{suppinfo:tab:corrections_parameters}.

\textbf{For Florian}

\newpage
\section{Results}
In this section, we start by our describing experimental data on the ionic transport through ClyA in terms of 
conductance, rectification and ion selectivity, and compare these directly with our continuum simulations. 
Next, we discuss the influence of the applied bias voltage and the bulk ionic strength on 3 distinct nanopore 
properties: 1) the distribution of cations and anions inside the pore, 2) the total electrostatic potential 
and 3) the electro-osmotic flow. 

\input{fig_conductance.tex}

\subsection{Transport of ions through ClyA}
% Key message: The extensions made to the PNP-NS equations are necessary to accurately predict the ionic current flowing through ClyA over a wide range of salt concentrations and bias voltages

\paragraph{Ionic current and conductance.}
The ionic current flowing through a nanopore is determined by both characteristics of the pore itself (i.e., 
its shape, size and electrostatic field), and by the properties of the electrolyte that surrounds it (i.e., 
ion diffusion coefficients, ion electrophoretic mobilities, solvent viscosity, density and relative 
permittivity). In order to reliably predict the ionic current, our nanopore simulation should thus not only 
contain an accurate geometry and charge distribution, it must also model all important transport processes 
(i.e., diffusion, electromigration and convection), which in turn should be parametrized with values relevant 
to the local conditions in the nanopore and the bulk electrolyte.

To validate the ionic currents predicted by our computational model of the biological nanopore ClyA-AS Type I 
(ClyA)\citep{soskine2013}, we used single-channel electrophysiology measure the current-voltage 
characteristics for \SIlist[list-units=single]{50;150;500;1000;3000}{\milli\Molar} \ce{NaCl} and between 
\SIlist[list-units=single]{-150;+150}{\milli\volt} with \SI{5}{\milli\volt} steps (\cref{fig:conductance}). 
The ionic current $\currentsim$ in our simulation was calculated by integration of the ionic flux 
$\vec{\flux_{i}}$ of each ion $i$ across the \textit{cis} reservoir boundary $S$:
\begin{equation}
	\currentsim = \faraday\int_{S}\left(\displaystyle\sum_{i} \chargen_{i}\normvec\cdot\vec{\flux_{i}}\right)dS  
\end{equation}
with $\faraday$ the Faraday constant (\SI{96.485}{\coulomb\per\mole}), $\chargen_{i}$ the ion charge number 
and $\normvec$ the normal vector. Simulations were performed at 
\SIlist[list-units=single]{1;5;10;25;50;75;100;125;150;200;250;300;400;500;750;1000;1500;2000;2500;3000;4000;5000}{\milli\Molar}.


In \cref{fig:conductance}a we plotted the experimental and simulated (PNP-NS and ePNP-NS) IV curves for 
several concentrations (\SIlist[list-units=single]{50;150;500;3000}{\milli\Molar}) which we deemed 
representative of the experimentally relevant range of ionic strengths. The IV curves of ClyA exhibit the 
typical rectification of a negatively charged conical nanopore, with higher currents at positive compared to 
negative bias.\textbf{REF} The magnitude of the rectification depends heavily on the salt concentration 

together with the simulated values obtained with the PNP-NS and the ePNP-NS equations.
While both models show the same qualitative trends as the experimental data, i.e.  in terms of ionic current rectification

From the IV curves we were able to calculate the ionic conductance ($\conductance = \current/\varpotential$) for bias voltages between \SIlist[list-units=single]{-150;+150}{mV} and
for bulk salt concentrations from \SIrange{50}{3000}{\milli\Molar} for the experimental (\cref{fig:conductance}b) and the simulated data (\cref{fig:conductance}c).
Experimentally, the conductance of ClyA rises from approximately \SIrange{0.5}{1}{\nano\siemens} at \SI{50}{\milli\Molar}

To better quantitatively judge the difference between the experimental and simulated conductances,
we calculated the their relative errors ($(\conductance_\textrm{sim}-\conductance_\textrm{exp})/\conductance_\textrm{exp}\times 100\%$)
can be found in \cref{fig:conductance}d for both PNP-NS (left) and ePNP-NS (right).
he PNP-NS equations overestimate the real ionic current under all tested conditions (\SIrange{40}{120}{\percent} deviation),
the ePNP-NS model shows significantly improved match with the experimental data (\SIrange{5}{10}{\percent} deviation).

For PNP-NS, the relative error increases with increasing ionic strength, 
In constrast, the error for ePNP-NS is decreases with increasing salt concentrations and po
In contrast,, with re By introducing the concentration dependent properties (ePNP-NS) results in a relative errors smaller that .

\paragraph{Ionic current rectification.}
A nanopore is said to exhibit ionic current rectification (ICR) when the conductance for a given bias voltage magnitude is higher when applied to one side of the nanopore compared to the other.
Here, we define the rectification $\icr$ as $\conductance_+/\conductance_-$, or the ratio between the absolute pore conductances for at positive and negative bias voltages.
ICR is a phenomenon often observed in nanopores that are both charged and contain a degree of geometrical asymmetry along the central axis of the pore.
With it's high negative charge (\SI{-72}{\elementarycharge} at \pH{7.5}) and different \textit{cis} (\SI{\approx 3.3}{\nano\meter}) and \textit{trans} (\SI{\approx 5.5}{\nano\meter}) entry diameters,
ClyA fulfils both conditions and hence exhibits a strong degree of rectification, which has been used to determine the orientation of the pore in the l
it exhibits a asymmetric at cis (\SI{5.5}{\nano\meter})




\cref{fig:rectification_contour} gives an overview experimentally determined and simulated (ePNP-NS) rectification magnitudes in terms of voltage and salt concentration.
A cross-section of these plots at \SI{100}{\milli\volt} is given in \cref{fig:rectification_section}.
 
% Experiments

While the ICR rises linearly with the applied bias voltage, the concentration dependency exhibits a maximum value of 1.28 for the experiment
The concentration dependence is not as trivial, and hence we plotted its values at \SI{100}{\milli\volt} vs. the bulk concentration in \cref{fig:rectification_section}
Due to the high degree of electrostatic screening, the ICR is close to unity (1.02) , but rises rapidly when ,The rectification rises concentration dependency is not so trivial, however, as it appears to show a maximum value of 1.28 at \SI{150}{\milli\Molar},
and decreasing for both lower and higher salt concentrations.

\subsection{Ion concentration distribution}
To improve our insight into the origin of the current rectification and ion selectivity, we investigated the ion concentrations inside the nanopore.

\paragraph{Average ion concentration inside the pore.}
To show the influence of the ionic strength and the applied bias voltage on the ion concentration inside the pore,
we computed the average ion concentration inside the pore, relative to the bulk value (\cref{fig:concentration_pore_average}).
In the case of \ce{Na+}, a clear enhancement is observed for 

The mean ion concentrations inside the nanopore, normalized by their corresponding bulk values, were plotted in \cref{fig:concentration_pore_average} against the bias voltage for range of bulk concentrations (\SIlist{5;50;150;500;1000;5000}{\mM}).
