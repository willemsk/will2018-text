\section{Introduction}

The transport of ions and molecules through nanoscale geometries is a field of intense study that uses both
experimental, theoretical and computational methods.\cite{Sparreboom-2010,Bocquet-2010,Maffeo-2012,
Thomas-2014,Wang-2014,Kim-2015} One of the primary driving forces behind this research is the development of
nanopores as label-free, stochastic sensors at the ultimate analytical limit (\ie{}~single molecule).
\cite{Bayley-2001,Dekker-2007,Venkatesan-2011,Zhang-2016} Such detectors have applications ranging from the
analysis of biopolymers such as
DNA\cite{Deamer-2016,Kasianowicz-1996,Meller-2000,Maglia-2008,Butler-2008,Stoddart-2009,Franceschini-2013,Jain-2018}
or proteins,\cite{Restrepo-Perez-2018,Talaga-2009,Rodriguez-Larrea-2013, Nivala-2013,Kennedy-2016} to the
detection and quantification of
biomarkers,\cite{Chen-2013,Soskine-2012,Niedzwiecki-2013,VanMeervelt-2014,Huang-2017,Liu-2018,Galenkamp-2018}
to the fundamental study of chemical or enzymatic reactions at the single molecular
level.\cite{Willems-VanMeervelt-2017,Lieberman-2010, Nivala-2013,Ho-2015,Laszlo-2017}

Nanopores are typically operated in the resistive-pulse mode, where the fluctuations of their ionic
conductance are monitored over time.\cite{Bayley-2001,Dekker-2007,Maglia-2010,Venkatesan-2011} Experimentally,
this is achieved by placing the nanopore between two electrolyte compartments and applying a constant DC (or
AC) voltage across them. Due to the high resistance of the nanopore, virtually the full potential change
occurs within (and around) the pore, resulting in a strong electric field ($10^6$--$10^7$~\si{\mV\per\nm})
that electrophoretically drives ions and water molecules through
it.\cite{Wong-2007,Mao-2014,Haywood-2014,Laohakunakorn-2015} Hence, analyte molecules such as DNA or proteins
are driven towards, and often \emph{through}, the nanopore by a combination of Coulombic (electrophoretic) and
hydrodynamic (electro-osmotic) forces.\cite{Wong-2007,Grosberg-2010,Muthukumar-2010, Muthukumar-2014} If
successful, a translocation event is observed as a temporal fluctuation in the ionic conductance of the pore
that serves as a unique molecular `fingerprint' with which the molecule can be identified.\cite{Yusko-2017}
Because the frequency, magnitude, duration and even noise levels of these events depend on the properties of
both the analyte molecule and the nanopore itself\todo{REF}, they are notoriously difficult to interpret unambiguously
without a full understanding of the nanofluidic phenomena that underlie them.

The computational approaches most widely used to study nanofluidic transport in ion channels or biological
nanopores comprise \emph{discrete} methods such as molecular dynamics
(MD)\cite{Lynden-Bell-1996,Allen-1999,Aksimentiev-2005,Luan-2008,Bhattacharya-2011,Zhang-2014,DiMarino-2015,Belkin-2016}
and Brownian dynamics
(BD),\cite{Schirmer-1999,Im-2002,Noskov-2004,Millar-2008,Egwolf-2010,DeBiase-2015,Pederson-2015} and
\emph{mean-field} (continuum) methods based on solving the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB)
equations\cite{Grochowski-2008, Baldessari-2008-1} and Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP)
equations.\cite{Eisenberg-1996,Gillespie-2002, Simakov-2010} The latter two can be coupled with the
Navier-Stokes (NS) equation to include electro-osmotically or pressure driven fluid
flow.\cite{Lu-2012,Pederson-2015} Due to their explicit atomic or particle nature, MD and BD simulations are
considered to yield the most accurate results. However, the large computational cost of simulating a complete
biological nanopore system (100K--1M atoms) for hundreds of nanoseconds still necessitates the use of
supercomputers.\cite{Aksimentiev-2005,Bhattacharya-2011} The PNP(-NS) equations, on the other hand, are of
particular interest due to their low computational demands and analytical tractability. In a continuum
approach, the simulated system is subdivided in several `structureless' domains, the behavior of which is
parameterized by material properties such as relative permittivity, diffusion coefficient, electrophoretic
mobility, viscosity and density. Because these properties can only emerge from the collective behavior or
interactions between small groups of atoms (\ie~the mean-field approximation), great care must be taken when
using them to compute fluxes and fields at the nanoscale, where computational elements may only contain a few
molecules.\cite{Corry-2000,Collins-2012} Nevertheless, even though the PNP equations have been used extensively for the
qualitative simulation of ion channels,\cite{Im-2002,Furini-2006,Liu-2015} biological
nanopores\cite{Simakov-2010,Pederson-2015,Aguilella-Arzo-2017,Simakov-2018} and their solid-state
counterparts,\cite{Cervera-2005,White-2008,Chaudhry-2014,Laohakunakorn-2015} the extent of their quantitative accuracy is often challenged.\cite{Corry-2000,Collins-2012,Maffeo-2012,Thomas-2014,Kim-2015}

To remedy the shortcomings of PNP and NS theory, a number of modifications have been proposed over the years.
These include, among others, 1) steric ion-ion interactions, 2) the effect of protein-ion/water interactions
on their motility (\ie~diffusivity and electrophoretic mobility), 3) the concentration dependencies of ion
motility, and solvent relative permittivity, viscosity and density.

The steric ion-ion interactions can be accounted for by computing the excess in chemical potential
($\mu_{i}^\text{ex}$) resulting from the finite size of the ions.\cite{Eisenberg-1996,Bazant-2009,
Daiguji-2010} Gillespie \etal{} combined PNP and density functional theory---where $\mu_{i}^\text{ex}$ was
split up in ideal, hard-sphere and electrostatic components---to successfully predict the selectivity and
current of ion channels.\cite{Gillespie-2002} In another approach, Kili\'{c} \etal{} derived a set of modified
PNP equations based on the free energy functional of the Borukhov's modified PB model\cite{Borukhov-1997}and
observed significantly more realistic concentrations for high surface potentials compared to the classical PNP
equations.\cite{Kilic-2007} To allow for non-identical ion sizes and more than two ion species, this model was
later extended by Lu \etal{}, who used it to probe the effect of finite ion size on the rate coefficients of
enzymes.\cite{Lu-2011}

The interaction of ions or small molecules such as water with the heavy atoms of proteins or DNA results in a
strong reduction of their motility, as observed in MD simulations.\cite{Makarov-1998,Pronk-2014} Since these
effects happen only at distances \SI{\le1}{\nm}, they can usually be neglected for macroscopic simulations.
However, in small nanopores ($\le10$~nm radius), they comprise a significant fraction of the total nanopore
radius and hence must be taken into account.\cite{Noskov-2004,Simakov-2010,Pederson-2015,McMullen-2017} In
continuum simulations, this can be achieved with the use of positional-dependent ion diffusion coefficients.
An example implementation is the `soft-repulsion PNP' developed by Simakov and Kurnikova,\cite{Simakov-2010,
Simakov-2018} who used it to predict the ionic conductance of the $\alpha$-hemolysin nanopore. Similar
reductions in ion diffusion coefficients have been proposed to improve PNP theory's estimations of the ionic
conductance of ion channels.\cite{Furini-2006,Liu-2015} The motility of water molecules is expressed by the NS
equations as the fluid's viscosity. Hence, as also observed in MD simulations for water molecules near
proteins\cite{Pronk-2014} and confined in hydrophilic nanopores,\cite{Qiao-Aluru-2003,Vo-2016,Hsu-2017} the
water-solid interaction leads to a viscosity several times higher compared to the bulk values. Note that this
is valid for hydrophilic interfaces only, as the lack of interaction with hydrophobic interfaces, such as
carbon nanotubes, leads to a lower viscosity.\cite{Ye-2011}

It is well known that the self-diffusion coefficient $\diffusion_{i}$ and electrophoretic mobility
$\mobility_{i}$ of an ion $i$ depends on the local concentrations of all the ions in the
electrolyte.\cite{ContrerasAburto-2013-1} Their values typically decrease with increasing salt concentration,
and should not be treated as constants. Moreover, even though the well-known Nernst-Einstein (NE) relation
$\mobility_{i}=\diffusion_{i}/\kT$ is strictly speaking only valid at infinite dilution and a good
approximation at low concentrations (\SI{<10}{\mM}), it significantly overestimates the ionic mobility at
higher salt concentrations.\cite{Mills-1989,Panopoulos-1986,ContrerasAburto-2013-1,ContrerasAburto-2013-2} In
an empirical approach, Baldessari and Santiago formulated an ionic-strength dependency of the ionic mobility
based on the activity coefficient of the salt\cite{Baldessari-2008-1} and showed excellent correspondence
between the experimental and simulated ionic conductance of long nanochannels over a wide concentration
range.\cite{Baldessari-2008-2} Alternatively, Burger \etal{} used a microscopic lattice-based model to derive
a set of PNP equations with non-linear, ion density-dependent mobilities and diffusion coefficients that
provided significantly more realistic results for ion channels.\cite{Burger-2012} Note that other electrolyte
properties, such as its viscosity,\cite{Hai-Lang-1996} density\cite{Hai-Lang-1996} and relative
permittivity,\cite{Gavish-2016} also significantly affect the ion and water flux. To better compute the charge
flux in ion channels, Chen derived a new PNP framework\cite{Chen-2016} that includes water-ion interactions in
the form of a concentration-dependent relative permittivity and an additional ion-water interaction energy
term.
% Axelsson \etal{} derived a
% set of NS equations that allowed for an incompressible fluid with a variable density and
% viscosity.\cite{Axelsson-2015}

To the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to consolidate all of the corrections discussed above
into a single framework. Hence, we propose an extended set of PNP-NS (ePNP-NS) equations, which improves the
predictive power of the PNP-NS equations at the nanoscale and beyond infinite dilution. Our ePNP-NS framework
takes into account the finite size of the ions using a size-modified PNP theory,\cite{Lu-2011} and implements
spatial-dependencies for the solvent viscosity,\cite{Pronk-2014,Hsu-2017} the ion diffusion coefficients and
their mobilities.\cite{Makarov-1998,Noskov-2004} It also includes self-consistent concentration-dependent
properties---based on empirical fits to experimental data---for both all ions in terms of diffusion
coefficients and mobilities,\cite{Baldessari-2008-1,Mills-1989} and the solvent in terms of density,
viscosity\cite{Hai-Lang-1996} and relative permittivity\cite{Gavish-2016}. To validate our new framework, we
applied it directly to a 2D-axisymmetric model of Cytolysin A (ClyA), a large protein nanopore that typically
contains 12 subunits\cite{Mueller-2009} or more\cite{Soskine-2013} and has been extensively used in
experimental studies of both proteins\cite{Soskine-2013,VanMeervelt-2014,Soskine-Biesemans-2015,
Biesemans-Soskine-2015,Wloka-2017,VanMeervelt-2017,Galenkamp-2018} and DNA.\cite{Franceschini-2013,
Franceschini-2016} This allowed us to gauge the qualitative and quantitative performance of the ePNP-NS
equations and simultaneously elucidate previously unaccessible details about the environment inside the pore.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In \emph{\nameref{sec:model}} we describe the equations
governing our ePNP-NS framework and detail the construction of the 2D-axisymmetric ClyA model. Next, in
\emph{\nameref{sec:results}}, we validate our model by direct comparison of simulated ionic conductance with
experimentally measured values. We then proceed to characterize the influence of the bulk ionic strength and
the applied bias voltage on cation and anion concentrations inside the pore, the electrostatic potential
distribution and magnitude of the electro-osmotic flow. Finally, we touch upon our key finding and their
impact in \emph{\nameref{sec:conclusions}} and describe our protocols in more detail in
\emph{\nameref{sec:methods}}.

\section{Mathematical model}\label{sec:model}

The use of \emph{continuum} or \emph{mean-field} representations for both the nanopore and the electrolyte
enables us to efficiently compute the steady-state ion and water fluxes under almost any condition. The
dynamic behavior of our complete system is described by the coupled Poisson, Nernst-Planck and Navier-Stokes
(PNP-NS) equations, a well-known set of partial differential equations that describe the electrostatic field,
the total ionic flux and the fluid flow, respectively.\cite{Eisenberg-1996,Cervera-2005,Lu-2012} In this
section we will describe all the components of the simulation, \ie~the 2D-axisymmetric nanopore geometry and
the system of governing equations.

\subsection{Model geometry}\label{sec:geom}

\paragraph{2D-axisymmetric model of ClyA}
%
ClyA is a relatively large protein nanopore that self-assembles on lipid bilayers to form \SI{14}{\nm} long
hydrophilic channels. The interior of the pore can be divided into roughly two cylindrical compartments
(\cref{fig:clya_side}): the \cisi{} \lumeni{} (\SI{\approx6}{\nm} diameter, \SI{\approx10}{\nm} height), and
the \transi{} constriction (\SI{\approx3.3}{\nm} diameter, \SI{\approx4}{\nm} height). Because ClyA consists
of 12 identical subunits (\cref{fig:clya_top}), it exhibits a high degree of radial symmetry, a geometrical
feature that can be exploited to obtain meaningful results at a much lower computational
cost.\cite{Cervera-2005,Lu-2012, Pederson-2015} However, this requires the reduction of the full 3D atomic
structure and charge distribution to a realistic 2D-axisymmetric model. To this end, we constructed a
full-atom homology model of ClyA-AS type I---a dodecameric variant of the wild type ClyA from \textit{S.
Typhii} artificially evolved for improved stability\cite{Soskine-2013}---and equilibrated it at
\SI{298.15}{\kelvin} for \SI{30}{\ns} in an explicit solvent with harmonic constraints on the protein backbone
atoms (see~\nameref{sec:methods} for details). From the final \SI{5}{\ns} of this trajectory we extracted 50
sets of atomic coordinates for ClyA (\ie~every \SI{100}{\ps}), in order to adequately represent the
conformational diversity of the side chains. For each of these structures, we computed a 2D atomic
density\cite{Li-2013} and charge\cite{Aksimentiev-2005} map (see~\nameref{sec:methods} for details), and the
final maps were obtained through averaging. The geometry of the nanopore was then defined as the
\SI{25}{\percent} contour line of the density map, which closely follows the outline of a \SI{30}{\degree}
`wedge' of the full atom structure (\cref{fig:model_geometry_vs_wedge}). The equilibrium charge map
(\cref{fig:model_charge_density}) was loaded directly into our solver as a linear interpolation function
($\scdpore$) and applied across all computational domains.

\paragraph{Global geometry.}
%
The complete system (\cref{fig:model_geometry_zoom,fig:model_geometry}) consists of a large hemispherical
electrolyte reservoir ($R=\SI{250}{\nm}$), split through the middle into a \cisi{} and a \transi{} compartment
by a lipid bilayer ($h=\SI{2.8}{\nm}$), which contains the nanopore at its center. Both the bilayer and the
nanopore are represented by dielectric blocks (see~\cref{tab:corrections_equations} for parameters) that are
impermeable to ions and water.


\subsection{Governing equations}\label{sec:goveq}

In an attempt to improve upon the quantitative accuracy of the PNP-NS equations for nanopore simulations, we
developed an \emph{extended} version of these equations (ePNP-NS) and implemented it in the commercial finite
element solver COMSOL Multiphysics (v5.4, www.comsol.com). Our ePNP-NS equations self-consistently take into
account 1) the finite size of the ions,\cite{Borukhov-1997,Lu-2011} 2) the reduction of ion and water motility
close to the nanopore walls,\cite{Makarov-1998,Noskov-2004,Pronk-2014,Pederson-2015,Vo-2016} and 3) the
concentration dependency of ion diffusion coefficients and electrophoretic mobilities, as well as electrolyte
viscosity, density and relative permittivity.\cite{Mills-1989,Hai-Lang-1996,Gavish-2016} Most of these
corrections make use of empirical functions that were fitted to experimental data, as explained below
(\cref{tab:corrections_equations,suppinfo:tab:corrections_parameters}).

\paragraph{Electrostatic field.}
% 
As mentioned above, the electrostatic potential is evaluated using Poisson's equation
%
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:poisson}
  \nabla \cdot \left(\absperm \relperm \nabla \potential \right) = -\left( \scdpore + \scdion \right)
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
%
with $\potential$ the electric potential, $\absperm$ the vacuum permittivity
(\SI{8.85419e-12}{\farad\per\meter}) and $\relperm$ local relative permittivity
(\cref{suppinfo:tab:corrections_parameters}).

The pore's \emph{fixed} charge distribution, $\scdpore$,  was derived directly from the full atom model of
ClyA-AS (see~\cref{eq:scdpore}). The \emph{ionic} charge density in the fluid is given by
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:scdion}
  \scdion = \faraday\sum_{i}\chargen_{i}\concentration_{i}
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
%
with $\faraday$ Faraday's constant (\SI{96485.33}{\coulomb\per\mole}), and $\concentration_{i}$ the ion
concentration and $\chargen_{i}$ ion charge number of ion $i$.

To account for the concentration dependence of the electrolyte's relative permittivity, we used the expression
%
\begin{align}
  \relperm(\avionconc) = \relperm^0 \relperm^c(\avionconc)
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
%
with $\avionconc=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n}\concentration_{i}$ the average ion concentration, $\relperm^0$ the
relative permittivity at infinite dilution and $\relperm^c(\avionconc)$ a concentration dependent empirical
function parameterized with experimental data.

%

\paragraph{Ionic flux.}
%
The total ionic flux $\flux_{i}$ of each ion $i$ is given by the size-modified Nernst-Planck
equation,\cite{Lu-2011} and can be expressed as the sum of diffusive, electrophoretic, convective and steric
fluxes
%
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:sm-nernst-planck}
  \flux_{i} = -\left[
    \diffusion_{i} \nabla \concentration_{i}
    + \chargen_{i} \mobility_{i} \concentration_{i} \nabla \potential
    - \velocity \concentration_{i}
    + \vec{\beta_{i}} \concentration_{i} \right]
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
%
where
%
\begin{align}
  \vec{\beta_{i}} =
      \frac{ \ionsize_{i}^3 / \ionsize_{0}^3 \dsum_{j} \ionsize_{j}^3 \nabla \concentration_{j} }
          { 1 - \dsum_{j} \avogadro \ionsize_{j}^3 \concentration_{j} }
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
%
and at steady state
%
\begin{align}
  \dfrac{\partial \concentration_{i}}{\partial \timedim} ={}& - \nabla \cdot \flux_{i} = 0
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
%
with $\diffusion_{i}$ the ion diffusion coefficient, $\concentration_{i}$ the ion concentration,
$\chargen_{i}$ the ion charge number, $\mobility_{i}$ the electrophoretic mobility of ion $i$. $\potential$ is
the electrostatic potential, $\velocity$ the fluid velocity and $\avogadro$ Avogadro's constant
(\SI{6.022e23}{\per\mole}). $\ionsize_{i}$ and $\ionsize_{0}$ are \emph{steric} cubic diameters of
respectively ions and water molecules. Because currently there are no experimentally verified values available
for $\ionsize_{i}$ and $\ionsize_{0}$, we set them to \SI{0.5}{\nm} (max. \SI{13.3}{\Molar}) and
\SI{0.311}{\nm} (max. \SI{55.2}{\Molar}).\cite{Bazant-2009}

The reduction of the ionic motility at increasing salt concentrations and in proximity to the nanopore walls
was implemented self-consistently by replacing $\diffusion_{i}$ and $\mobility_{i}$ with the expressions
%
\begin{align}
  \diffusion_{i}(\avionconc,\walldistance) ={}&
      \diffusion_{i}^0 \diffusion_{i}^c(\avionconc) \diffusion_{i}^w(\walldistance)  \\
  \mobility_{i}(\avionconc,\walldistance) ={}&
      \mobility_{i}^0 \mobility_{i}^c(\avionconc) \mobility_{i}^w(\walldistance)
\end{align}
%
where $\diffusion_{i}^0$ and $\mobility_{i}^0$ represent the values at infinite dilution. The concentration
dependent factors $\diffusion_{i}^c(\avionconc)$ and $\mobility_{i}^c(\avionconc)$ are empirical functions
fitted to experimental data (between \SIrange{0}{5}{\Molar} \ce{NaCl}) of respectively the ion self-diffusion
coefficients\cite{Mills-1989} and the electrophoretic
mobilities.\cite{Bianchi-1989,Currie-1960,Goldsack-1976,DellaMonica-1979} Likewise, the factors
$\diffusion_{i}^w(\walldistance)$ and $\mobility_{i}^w(\walldistance)$ are empirical functions that introduce
a spatial dependency on the distance from the nanopore wall $\walldistance$, and were parameterized by fitting
to molecular dynamics data.\cite{Noskov-2004,Simakov-2010,Makarov-1998}

Based on the observation that the diffusivity of nanometer- to micrometer-sized particles reduces
significantly when confined in pores and slits of comparable dimensions,\cite{Renkin-1954,Deen-1987,
Dechadilok-2006,Muthukumar-2014,Kannam-2017} Simakov \etal{}\cite{Simakov-2010} and Pederson
\etal{}\cite{Pederson-2015} reduced the ion motilities inside the pore as a function of the ratio between the
ion and the nanopore radii. We chose not to include this correction into our model, as extrapolating its
applicability for ions with a hydrodynamic radii comparable to size of the solvent molecules is
questionable.\cite{Anderson-1972,Deen-1987}

\paragraph{Fluid flow.}
%
As derived by Axelsson \etal{},\cite{Axelsson-2015} the fluid flow and pressure field inside an incompressible fluid with a variable density and variable viscosity is given by the Navier-Stokes equations:
%
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:navier-stokes-variable}
  \dfrac{\partial}{\partial \timedim} \left( \density \velocity \right) +
  \left( \velocity \cdot \nabla \right) \left( \density\velocity \right)
  + \nabla \cdot \hydrostresstensor = \vec{\force}
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
%
where
%
\begin{align}
  \hydrostresstensor =
  \pressure\identity - \viscosity\left[\nabla\velocity+\left(\nabla\velocity \right)^\mathsf{T}\right]
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
%
together with the continuity equations for the fluid density
%
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:continuity-density}
  \dfrac{\partial \density}{\partial \timedim} + \velocity \cdot \nabla \density  = 0
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
%
and the fluid velocity
%
\begin{align}
  % \left( \velocity \cdot \nabla \right) \left( \density\velocity \right)
  % \nabla \cdot \left( \density\velocity \right) - \velocity \cdot \nabla \density ={}& 0
  \velocity \cdot \nabla \left( \density\velocity \right)
  - \velocity \cdot \nabla \density ={}& 0
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
%
with $\velocity$ the fluid velocity, $\density$ the fluid density, $\hydrostresstensor$ the hydrodynamic
stress tensor, $\viscosity$ the viscosity and $\pressure$ the pressure. The external body force density
$\vec{\force}$ that acts on the fluid is given by
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:ion_force_density}
  \vec{\force} = \echarge\avogadro\scdion\efield
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
%
with $\efield = - \nabla \potential$ the electric field vector.

At steady-state, the partial derivatives w.r.t. time in \cref{eq:navier-stokes-variable,eq:continuity-density}
become equal to zero:
\begin{align}
  \dfrac{\partial}{\partial \timedim} \left( \density \velocity \right) ={}& 0 \\
  \dfrac{\partial \density}{\partial \timedim} ={}& 0
  \text{\,.}
\end{align}

As with the previous equations, we introduced a concentration dependency and wall distance dependencies for
$\viscosity$ and a concentration dependency for the $\density$ by replacing their constant values by
%
\begin{align}
  \viscosity(\avionconc,\walldistance) ={}&
    \viscosity^0 \viscosity^c(\avionconc) \viscosity^w(\walldistance) \\
  \density(\avionconc) ={}&
    \density^0 \density^c(\avionconc)
\end{align}
%
where $\viscosity^0$ and $\density^0$ are the values at infinite dilution (\ie~pure water). The empirical
functions $\viscosity^c(\avionconc)$, $\density^c(\avionconc)$ and $\viscosity^w(\walldistance)$ were
parameterized \textit{via} fitting to experimental\cite{Hai-Lang-1996} and molecular dynamics\cite{Pronk-2014}
data obtained from literature.

\subsection{Boundary conditions and concentration dependencies}
%
The reservoir boundaries were set up, with Dirichlet conditions, to act as electrodes: the \cisi{} side was
grounded ($\potential = 0$) and a fixed, but changeable, bias potential was applied along the \transi{} edge
($\potential = \vbias$). To simulate the presence of an endless reservoir, the ion concentration at both
external boundaries were fixed to the bulk salt concentration ($\concentration_i = \cbulk$) and the
unconstrained flow in and out of the computational domain was enabled by means of a `no normal stress`
condition ($\hydrostresstensor\vec{n} = 0$). The boundary conditions on the edges of the reservoir shared with
the nanopore and bilayer were set to no-flux ($-\vec{n}\cdot\vec{\flux}_{i} = 0$) and no-slip
($\vec{\velocity} = 0$), preventing the flux of ions through them and mimicking a sticky hydrophilic surface,
respectively. Finally, a Neumann boundary condition was applied at the bilayer's external boundary
($-\vec{n}\cdot\left(\absperm \relperm \nabla \potential \right) = 0$).
%
All concentration dependent parameters use the local ionic strength rather than their individual ion
concentrations. Though valid for \emph{electroneutral} bulk solutions, this approximation no longer holds
inside the electrical double layer (\ie~near charged surfaces or inside small nanopores), where local
electroneutrality is violated. The main reasons for nevertheless making this simplification are the lack of
non-bulk experimental data and the absence of a tractable analytical model. Furthermore, we will see that the
current implementation of our concentration dependent functions will lead to an excellent agreement with the
experimental data in all but the most extreme cases, justifying our choice \textit{a posteriori}. 
%
The ePNP-NS equations revert into the regular PNP-NS equations disabling the steric flux ($\vec{\beta}=0$) and
by setting all concentration and wall distance functions to unity ($\relperm = \relperm^0$, $\diffusion_{i} =
\diffusion_{i}^0$, $\mobility_{i} = \mobility_{i}^0$, $\viscosity = \viscosity^0$ and $\density =
\density^0$).

\section{Results and Discussion}\label{sec:results}

The current--voltage (IV) relationships of many nanopores, ClyA included, often deviate significantly from
Ohm's law. This is because the ionic flux arises from a complex interplay between the pore's geometry
(\eg~size, shape and charge distribution), the properties of the surrounding electrolyte (\eg~salt
concentration viscosity and relative permittivity) and the externally applied conditions (\eg~bias voltage,
temperature and pressure). The ability of a computational model to quantitatively predict the ionic current of
a nanopore over a wide range of bias voltages and salt concentrations strongly indicates that it captures the
essential physics governing the nanofluidic transport. Hence, to validate our model, we experimentally
measured the single channel ionic conductance of ClyA at a wide range of experimentally relevant salt
concentrations ($\cbulk$) and bias voltages ($\vbias$). We compared these experimental data with the simulated ionic transport
properties in terms of current, conductance, rectification and ion selectivity, of both the classical PNP-NS
and the newly developed ePNP-NS equations---finding a quantitative match between the experiment and the simulations.

% After validation, we proceed with describing the influence of the
% bias voltage ($\vbias$) and bulk salt concentration ($\cbulk$) on the local ion and charge distribution and
% inside the pore. This is followed by a characterization of the electrostatic potential and the electrostatic
% energy landscape within ClyA for both cations and anions. We will conclude this section by discussing the
% properties of the electro-osmotic flow.
% and a brief reflection of the key findings in this work.

\subsection{Transport of Ions Through ClyA}\label{sec:iont}

\paragraph{Ionic current and conductance.}
%
The ability of our model to reproduce the ionic current of a biological nanopore over a wide range of
experimentally relevant conditions (between $\vbias = \text{\SIrange{-150}{+150}{\mV}}$ and for $\cbulk =
\text{\SIlist{0.05;0.15;0.5;1;3}{\Molar}}$ \ce{NaCl}) can be seen in \cref{fig:current-voltage_curves}. Here,
we compare IV relationships of ClyA-AS as measured experimentally (`expt.'), simulated using our
2D-axisymmetric model (`PNP-NS' and `ePNP-NS') and naively analytically estimated (`bulk') using a resistor
model of the pore\cite{Soskine-2013,Kowalczyk-2011}
(\cref{suppinfo:eq:bulk_nanopore_current,suppinfo:eq:bulk_nanopore_conductance}). Whereas the classical PNP-NS
equations consistently overestimated the ionic current, particularly at high salt concentrations, the
predictions of the ePNP-NS equations corresponded closely to the measured values, \emph{especially} at high
ionic strengths ($\cbulk > \text{\SI{0.5}{\Molar}}$). The inability of the classical PNP-NS equations to
correctly estimate the current is expected however, as in this regime the model parameters (\eg~diffusivity,
mobility and viscosity, ...) begin to deviate significantly from their `infinite dilution' values
(see~\cref{suppinfo:fig:corrections}). At $\cbulk < \text{\SI{0.15}{\Molar}}$ the ePNP-NS equations tended to
subtly overestimate the ionic current, but the discrepancies were much smaller than those observed for PNP-NS.
Finally, the bulk model managed to capture the currents surprisingly well at high salt concentrations and
positive bias voltages, but faltered in the negative voltage regime. 

The ability of a nanopore to conduct ions can be best expressed by its conductance: $\conductance = \current /
\vbias$. We computed ClyA's conductance with the ePNP-NS equations as a function of bias voltage
($\vbias=\text{\SIrange{-200}{+200}{\mV}}$) and bulk \ce{NaCl} concentration
($\cbulk=\text{\SIrange{0.005}{5}{\Molar}}$), of which a contour plot can be found in
\cref{fig:conductance_contourmap_epnp}. The near horizontal contour lines in the upper part of the plot
($\cbulk>\SI{1}{\Molar}$) show that, at high ionic strengths, ClyA maintains the same conductance regardless
of the applied bias voltage. This behavior changes at intermediate concentrations
($\SI{0.1}{\Molar}<\cbulk<\SI{1}{\Molar}$), where maintaining the same conductance level with increasing
negative bias amplitudes requires increasing salt concentrations. Finally, at low salt concentrations
($\cbulk<\SI{0.1}{\Molar}$), the ionic conductance increases when reducing the negative voltage amplitude but
subsequently levels out at positive bias voltages.

The cross-sections of the ionic conductance as a function of concentration at high positive and negative bias
voltages (\cref{fig:conductance_loglog_exp_pnp_epnp}), serve to demonstrate the differences between these
respective regimes. At high positive (\SI{+150}{\mV}) and negative (\SI{-150}{\mV}) bias voltages, the slopes
of the conductance log-log plots with respect to the bulk salt concentration show linear and bi-linear
behavior, respectively. This could be indicative of a different mode of ion conduction of positive and
negative bias voltages, at least for concentrations \SI{<0.15}{\Molar}. The bulk model and the PNP-NS
equations manage to capture the conductance at respectively high and low ionic strengths, only the ePNP-NS
equations perform well over the entire concentration range. Overall, the predictions made using PNP-NS
overestimate the conductance over the entire concentration range, but they do converge with those computed
with ePNP-NS when approaching infinite dilution (\SI{<0.01}{\Molar}).
% At $\vbias = \text{\SI{-150}{\mV}}$, the log-log plot consists of two linear segments with a transition zone
% at $\cbulk \approx \text{\SI{0.15}{\Molar}}$. This behavior is captured qualitatively by both simulation
% methods, but an excellent quantitative match is only found for the ePNP-NS equations. The bulk model
% exhibits the same single-sloped trend as seen at $\vbias = \text{\SI{+150}{\mV}}$.

The difference in ionic conduction at opposing bias voltages is also known as ionic current rectification
(ICR): $\icr(\vbias) = \conductance(+\vbias) / \conductance(-\vbias)$. ICR is a phenomenon often observed in
nanopores that are both charged, and contain a degree of geometrical asymmetry along the central axis of the
pore.\cite{Constantin-2007,White-2008,Wang-2014} As can be seen in \cref{suppinfo:fig:icr}, ClyA exhibits a
strong degree of rectification, which is to be expected given its predominantly negatively charged interior
and asymmetric \cisi{} (\SI{\approx3.3}{\nm}) and \transi{} (\SI{\approx6}{\nm}) entry diameters
(\cref{fig:clya_side}). We found $\icr$ to increase monotonously with the bias voltage magnitude, at least
over the investigated range. We found the dependence of $\icr$ on the ionic strength not to be monotonous, but
rather rising rapidly to a peak value at \SI{\approx0.15}{\Molar}, followed by a gradual decline towards unity
at saturating salt concentrations. This concentration is within the transition zone observed in the
conductance at negative bias voltages (\cref{fig:conductance_loglog_exp_pnp_epnp}), and provides further
evidence for a change in the conductive properties of the pore.

The results and comparisons discussed above indicate that ClyA's conductivity is dominated by the bulk
electrolyte conductivity above physiological salt concentrations ($\cbulk > \text{\SI{0.15}{\Molar}}$). The
breakdown of this simple dependency at lower ionic strengths is particularly evident at negative bias voltages
and is likely caused by the overlapping of the electrical double layer inside the pore (\ie~at \SI{0.05}{\Molar} the EDL \SI{\approx1.4}{\nm}). This effectively
excludes the co-ions---\Cl{} in the case---from the interior of the pore, preventing them from contributing to
total ionic conductance and resulting in a conductance dominated by the surface charge.\cite{Uematsu-2018} The
presence of only a single ion type inside the pore may also offer an explanation as to why the ePNP-NS
equations are more accurate at higher ionic strengths (\SI{\ge0.15}{\Molar}). Because our ionic mobilities are derived from \emph{bulk} ionic
conductances, \ie~for unconfined ions in a locally \emph{electroneutral} environment, it is likely that our
mobility model begins to break down under conditions where only a single ion type is present.\cite{Duan-2010}
Another cause of the discrepancies could be a slight narrowing of the nanopore at low salt concentrations, which cannot be captured by our simulation due to the static nature of its geometry and charge distributions. Nevertheless,
our simplified 2D-axisymmetric model, in conjunction with the ePNP-NS equations, is able to accurately predict
the ionic current flowing through ClyA for a wide range of experimentally relevant ionic strengths and bias
voltages. This suggests that this continuum system can accurately capture the essential physical phenomena that drive the ion and
water transport through the nanopore both qualitatively and quantitatively. Hence, we expect the distribution
of the resulting properties (\eg~ion concentrations, ion fluxes, electric field and water velocity) to closely
correspond to their true values. \todo{discuss more extensively}

\paragraph{Cation selectivity.}
%
The ion selectivity of a nanopore determines the preference with which it transports one ion type over the
other. Experimentally, it is often determined by placing the pore in a salt gradient (\ie~different salt
concentrations in the \cisi{} and \transi{} reservoirs) and measuring the potential at which the nanopore
current is zero (reversal potential, $\revpot$).\cite{Soskine-2013,Franceschini-2016} The Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz
(GHK) equation can then be used to convert $\revpot$ into the permeability ratio $\pna = \gna / \gcl$. Here,
we represent the ClyA's ion selectivity
%
(\cref{fig:transport_number_contourmap_epnp,fig:transport_number_vs_concentration_bulk_pnp_epnp}) 
%
by the fraction of the total current that is carried by \Na{} ions: the apparent \Na{} transport number
$\tna = \gna / (\gna + \gcl) = \pna / (\pna + 1)$. 

Due to its negatively charged interior, we found ClyA to be cation selective (\ie~$\tna > 0.5$) for all
investigated voltages up to a bulk salt concentration of $\cbulk \approx \text{\SI{2}{\Molar}}$ \ce{NaCl} (0.5
contour line in \cref{fig:transport_number_contourmap_epnp}). Above this concentration, $\tna$ falls to a
minimum of value of 0.45 at $\cbulk \approx \text{\SI{5}{\Molar}}$, which is still \num{\approx1.27} times its
value in the bulk electrolyte (0.35). This shows that---even at saturating concentrations where the Debye length is \SI{<0.2}{\nm}---ClyA enhances the transport of cations. Below \SI{2}{\Molar}, the ion selectivity increases logarithmically with decreasing salt
concentrations, but it also becomes more sensitive to the direction and magnitude of the electric field:  with
negative bias voltages yielding higher ion selectivities
(\cref{fig:transport_number_vs_concentration_bulk_pnp_epnp}). For example, to reach a selectivity of $\tna
\approx 0.9$, the salt concentration must fall to \SI{0.05}{\Molar} at \SI{+150}{\mV} and to only
\SI{0.125}{\Molar} at \SI{-150}{\mV}.

Using the reversal potential method, Franceschini \etal{}\cite{Franceschini-2016} found ClyA's ion selectivity
to be $\tna = 0.66$ ($\pna = 1.9$). This corresponds well to the average between the \cisi{}
(\SI{1}{\Molar}, $\tna = 0.57$, $\pna = 1.3$) and \transi{} (\SI{0.15}{\Molar}, $\tna = 0.84$, $\pna = 5.4$)
reservoir concentrations used in their experiment. Therefore, this suggests that although measuring the reversal potential gives
valuable insights into the selectivity ion channels and small nanopores, it does not actually describe the ion selectivity under \emph{symmetric} conditions. In addition, tThe GHK equation does not consider the ionic flux due to the electro-osmotic
flow and assumes that the Nernst-Einstein relation holds for all used concentrations. These two effects should
not be ignored as they contribute significantly to the total conductance of the pore. Furthermore, because the
ion selectivity depends strongly on the ionic strength and often the applied bias voltage, the measured reversal potential will necessarily be
influenced by the chosen salt gradient and represents the selectivity at an undetermined intermediate
concentration.

Following the validation of the model in preceding section, we now proceed by describing the local ionic
concentrations inside ClyA. Detailed knowledge of the ionic environment can be valuable to experimentalists
who seek to trap and study single enzymes with
ClyA.\cite{Soskine-Biesemans-2015,VanMeervelt-2017,Galenkamp-2018} Moreover, it gives insight into the origin
of the ion current rectification, ion selectivity and the electro-osmotic flow. We evaluated the densities of
both \Na{} and \Cl{} ions inside ClyA and investigated the effect of bulk salt concentration and the bias
voltage on 1) the distribution of their concentration
(\cref{fig:concentration_pore_average_vs_cbulk,fig:concentration_contours,fig:concentration_radial_profiles})
and 2) the accumulation of mobile charges inside the pore as a result of their asymmetric enhancement or
depletion (\cref{fig:ion_charge_dist_vs_cbulk,fig:ion_scd_contours,fig:ion_scd_radial_profiles}).

\paragraph{Relative cation and anion concentrations.}
%
The relative ion concentration averaged over the entire volume of the pore ($\pavi$) as a function of bulk
concentration (\cref{fig:concentration_pore_average_vs_cbulk}), gives a good measure for global situation
inside the pore. At low ionic strengths ($\cbulk < \text{\SI{0.05}{\Molar}}$), our simulation predicts a
strong enhancement of the \Na{} (cation) concentration ($\pavNa$) and a clear depletion of the \Cl{} (anion)
concentration ($\pavCl$) inside the pore. This effect diminishes rapidly with increasing ionic
strengths, which can be explained by the electrolytic screening of the negative charges lining the walls of
ClyA (\ie~the electrical double layer). At low bulk concentrations the number of ions in the bulk is sparse,
leading to the attraction and repulsion of respectively as many \Na{} and \Cl{} ions as the chemical potential
allows. As the concentration increases, the overall availability of ions improves and the extreme
concentration differences between the pore and the bulk are no longer required to offset ClyA's fixed charges.
For example, changing the bulk concentration from \SIrange{0.005}{0.05}{\Molar} under equilibrium conditions
($\vbias = \text{\SI{0}{\mV}}$), causes the relative \Na{} and \Cl{} concentrations to fall and rise from
\numrange{34}{4.4} and from \numrange{0.05}{0.31}, respectively. At $\cbulk = \text{\SI{0.15}{\Molar}}$, the
values still differ significantly from bulk ($\pavNa = 2.1$ and $\pavCl = 0.58$), but they fall back to
\SI{<15}{\percent} of unity at $\cbulk = \text{\SI{1}{\Molar}}$ ($\pavNa = 1.14$ and $\pavCl = 0.89$).

We also observed a stark difference between their sensitivities to the applied bias voltage, particularly at
low salt concentrations (\cref{fig:concentration_pore_average_vs_cbulk}, left of \SI{<0.15}{\Molar} line).
Whereas the \Na{} concentration shows only a limited response, the \Cl{} concentration changes much more
dramatically. For example, at $\cbulk = \text{\SI{0.15}{\Molar}}$ and from $\vbias =
\text{\SIrange{-150}{+150}{\mV}}$, $\pavNa$ rises \num{\approx 1.7}-fold (\numrange{1.6}{2.7}) and $\pavCl$
increases \num{\approx 3.8}-fold (\numrange{0.28}{1.06}). This difference is clearly visualized by the contour
plots of the relative ion concentrations ($\ci/\cbulk$) at $\cbulk = \text{\SI{0.15}{\Molar}}$ and for $\vbias
= \text{\SIlist{-150;+150}{\mV}}$ (\cref{fig:concentration_contours}). They reveal that the \transi{}
constriction ($\num{-1.85} < z < \text{\SI{1.6}{\nm}}$) remains depleted of \Cl{} and enhanced in \Na{} for
both $\vbias = \text{\SI{-150}{\mV}}$ and $\vbias = \text{\SI{+150}{\mV}}$. This is not the case in the
\lumeni{} ($\num{1.6} < z < \text{\SI{12.25}{\nm}}$), in which the \Na{} concentration is bulk-like for
$\vbias < \text{\SI{0}{\mV}}$ and enhanced for $\vbias > \text{\SI{0}{\mV}}$. Conversely, the number of \Cl{}
ions becomes more and more depleted in the \lumeni{} for increasing negative bias magnitudes, and it is
virtually bulk-like at higher positive bias voltages. This is further exemplified by the radial profiles of
the ion concentrations (\cref{fig:concentration_radial_profiles}) through the middle of the constriction ($z =
\text{\SI{-0.3}{\nm}}$) and the \lumeni{} ($ z = \text{\SI{5}{\nm}}$), which also clearly shows the extent of
the electrical double layer.

% Note that the figures given above were obtained from a nanoscale continuum steady-state simulation, and
% hence represent a time-averaged situation (typically on the order of \SIrange{10}{100}{\ns}).


\paragraph{Ion Charge Density.}
%
The formation of an electrical double layer inside the pore, and the resulting asymmetry in the cation and
anion concentrations, gives rise to a net charge density inside the pore ($\scdion$, \cref{eq:scdion}). To
investigate the distribution of these charges within ClyA, we divided the total interior volume of the pore
(PT) into a `pore surface' (PS) and a `pore bulk' (PB) region. The PB region encompasses a cylindrical volume
at the enter of the pore up until \SI{0.5}{\nm} distance from the wall
($\walldistance \ge \text{\SI{0.5}{\nm}}$), and the PS region includes the remaining volume between the PB
domain and the nanopore wall ($\walldistance < \text{\SI{0.5}{\nm}}$). Integration of $\scdion$ over the PS
and PB regions yields the average number of mobile charges present inside those locations
(\cref{fig:ion_charge_dist_vs_cbulk}): $\pav{\Qion}{\text{PB}}$ and $\pav{\Qion}{\text{PS}}$, respectively.
Although the total number of charges inside the pore, $\pav{\Qion}{\text{PT}} = \pav{\Qion}{\text{PB}} +
\pav{\Qion}{\text{PS}}$, rises appreciatively with increasing reservoir concentrations, the majority of these
additional charges are confined to the surface of the pore.
Up until $\cbulk=\text{\SI{\approx0.15}{\Molar}}$, $\pav{\Qion}{\text{PT}}$ is distributed equally between
the surface (\SI{\approx+27}{\ec}) and bulk (\SI{\approx+22}{\ec}) layers.
At higher concentrations, the number of charges in the surface layer more than doubles (towards
$\pav{\Qion}{\text{PS}}=\text{\SI{+58}{\ec}}$ at \SI{5}{\Molar}), and those in the bulk of the pore diminish
(towards $\pav{\Qion}{\text{PB}} \approx \text{\SI{0}{\ec}}$ at \SI{5}{\Molar}). The total number of mobile
charges $\pav{\Qion}{\text{PT}}$ also depend on the applied bias voltage. As can be seen from our simulation
results for three different voltages (\cref{fig:ion_charge_dist_vs_cbulk}), $\pav{\Qion}{\text{PT}}$ is
approximately \SIrange{+10}{+15}{\ec} higher at $\vbias = \text{\SI{+150}{\mV}}$ as compared to $\vbias =
\text{\SI{-150}{\mV}}$ for the full range of ion concentrations. Interestingly, at higher salt concentrations
this increased number of charges with voltage is fully accounted for by the surface charges, as the charge
density in the bulk does not change with the applied voltage.

The cross-section contour plots of $\scdion$ inside ClyA for four different bulk concentrations ($\cbulk =
\text{\SIlist{0.05;0.15;0.5;5}{\Molar}}$) reveal the redistribution of the mobile charges with increasing
ionic strength in more detail. Up until a bulk concentration of $\cbulk = \text{\SI{\le0.5}{\Molar}}$, the
electrical double layer inside the pore overlaps significantly with itself (\cref{fig:ion_scd_contours}, 3
leftmost panels), giving rise to a net positive charge diffused throughout the entire pore.
Moreover, the absence of \Cl{} ions prevents the formation of any significant negative charge densities next
to the few positively charged residues lining the pore walls. The situation at high salt concentrations
(\eg~\SI{5}{\Molar}) is very different, with almost no charge density within the PB region of the pore
($\walldistance \ge \text{\SI{0.5}{\nm}}$), but with pockets of highly charged and alternating positive and
negative charge densities close to the nanopore wall (\cref{fig:ion_scd_contours}, rightmost panel). This
sharp confinement is shown clearly by the radial density profiles (\cref{fig:ion_scd_radial_profiles}) drawn
through the constriction ($z = \text{\SI{-0.3}{\nm}}$, purple triangles) and the \lumeni{} ($z =
\text{\SI{5}{\nm}}$, green triangles).

\end{figure*}

The electrostatic potential, or rather the change thereof, is one of the primary driving forces within a
nanopore. Typically, the potential can be split into an intrinsic, `equilibrium' component and an external,
`non-equilibrium' contribution. The latter is also known as the bias voltage applied between the \transi{} and
the \cisi{} reservoirs, and most of it changes across the short distance of the nanopore itself. For a
\SI{14}{\nm}-long nanopore such as ClyA, a potential drop of \SIrange{10}{100}{\mV} can easily create an
electric field of $10^6$--$10^7$~\si{\volt\per\meter} inside the pore. The intrinsic electrostatic potential
results from the charged residues embedded in the interior walls of the protein and can significantly
influence the transport of ions and water molecules through the
pore.\cite{Aksimentiev-2005,Bhattacharya-2011,DeBiase-2015,Basdevant-2019} In the following section we aim to
describe the most salient features of this potential and the extent of its influence over the entire
investigated concentration range (\cref{fig:potential}). Moreover, because electromigration is the primary
contributor to the ionic current, a proper understanding of the electrostatic landscape---and the energy
barriers faced by the ions traversing the pore---should provide a more quantitative explanation for the origin
of ClyA's rectification, ion selectivity and asymmetric ion concentrations.

\paragraph{A few important charged residues.}
%
The interior walls of the ClyA nanopore (\cref{fig:potential_clya_charges}) are riddled with negatively
charged amino amids (\ie~aspartic acid or glutamic acid), interspaced by a few positively charged residues 
(\ie~lysine or arginine). When grouping these charges by proximity, we found three clusters with significantly
more negative than positive residues: inside the \transi{} constriction ($\num{-1.85}<z<\text{\SI{1.6}{\nm}}$;
E7, E11, K14, E18, D21, D25), in the middle of the \cisi{} \lumeni{} ($\num{4} < z < \text{\SI{6}{\nm}}$; E53,
E57, D64, K147) and at the top of the pore ($\num{10} < z < \text{\SI{12}{\nm}}$; D114, R118, D121, D122).
As we shall see, these clusters leave strong negative fingerprints in the global electrostatic potential.

\paragraph{Distribution of the equilibrium electrostatic potential.}
%
The electrostatic potential at equilibrium ($\eqpot$, \ie~at $\vbias = \text{\SI{0}{\mV}}$) reveals the effect
of ClyA's fixed charges on the potential inside the pore (\cref{fig:potential_contours}). Due to electric
screening by the mobile charge carriers in the electrolyte, however, the extent of their influence strongly
depends on the bulk ionic strength. The contour plot cross-sections of $\eqpot$ for $\cbulk =
\text{\SIlist{0.005;0.05;0.15;0.5;5}{\Molar}}$ (\cref{fig:potential_contours}) and their corresponding radial
averages (\cref{fig:potential_radial_averages}) demonstrate this effect aptly. The radial average
($\radeqpot$) represents the mean value along the longitudinal axis of the pore and can be computed using
%
\begin{align}
  \radpot=\dfrac{1}{\pi R(z)^2}\int_{0}^{R(z)}\potential(r,z) \;2 \pi r \; dr \text{\,,}
\end{align}
%
where $R(z)$ is taken as the pore radius for $\num{-1.85} \le z \le \text{\SI{12.25}{\nm}}$, \SI{2}{\nm} for
$z < \text{\SI{-1.85}{\nm}}$ and \SI{4}{\nm} for $z > \text{\SI{12.25}{\nm}}$. Starting from the \cisi{} entry
($z \approx \SI{10}{\nm}$), the electrostatic potential is dominated by the acidic residues D114, D121 and
D122, resulting in a rapid reduction of $\radeqpot$ upon entering the pore. Next, $\radeqpot$ slowly
decreases up until the middle of the \lumeni{} ($z \approx \text{\SI{5}{\nm}}$), where the next set of
negative residues, namely E53, E57 and D64, lower it even further. After a brief increase, $\radeqpot$ attains
its maximum amplitude inside the \transi{} constriction ($z \approx \text{\SI{0}{\nm}}$) due to the close
proximity of the amino acids E7, E11, E18, D21 and D25, and then quickly falls to \num{0} inside the \transi{}
reservoir.

At low ionic strengths ($\cbulk < \text{\SI{0.05}{\Molar}}$), the lack of sufficient ionic screening results
in relatively high negative potentials throughout the entire pore. For example, for $\cbulk =
\text{\SIlist{0.005;0.05}{\Molar}}$, the $\radeqpot$ inside the constriction ramps up to values of
\SI{-144}{\mV} (\SI{-5.60}{\kTe}) and \SI{-86}{\mV} (\SI{-3.35}{\kTe}), respectively. These values
significantly exceed the single ion thermal voltage $\kTe = \text{\SI{25.7}{\mV}}$. Hence, on the one hand
they prohibit anions such as \Cl{} from entering the pore, and on the other they attract cations such as \Na{}
and trap them inside the pore. For intermediate concentrations ($\num{0.05} \le \cbulk <
\text{\SI{0.5}{\Molar}}$) the influence of the negative charges becomes increasingly confined to several
`hotspots' near the nanopore walls, most notably at entry of the pore ($\num{10} < z < \text{\SI{12}{\nm}}$),
in the middle of the \lumeni{} ($\num{4} < z < \text{\SI{6}{\nm}}$), and in the constriction ($\num{-1.85} < z
< \text{\SI{1.6}{\nm}}$), in accordance with the charge groups discussed in the previous section. Even though
the magnitude of $\radeqpot$ at $\cbulk = \text{\SI{0.15}{\Molar}}$ drops below \SI{1}{\kTe} inside the
\lumeni{} ($\radeqpot \approx \text{\SI{-14}{\mV}}$), it remains strongly negative inside the constriction
($\radeqpot \approx \text{\SI{-47}{\mV}}$). Finally, at high concentrations ($\cbulk \ge
\text{\SI{0.5}{\Molar}}$) the potential is close to \SI{\approx0}{\mV} over the entire \lumeni{} of the pore,
with only a small negative potential remaining inside the constriction. A summary of the most salient
$\radeqpot$ values can be found in \cref{suppinfo:tab:radial_potential}.

\paragraph{Non-equilibrium electrostatic energy at $\mathbf{+150}$ and $\mathbf{-150}$~mV.}
%
To link back the observed ionic conductance properties to the electrostatic potential, we computed the
radially averaged electrostatic energy for a monovalent ion, $\radenergy = \chargen_{i} \echarge \radpot$, at
$\vbias = \text{\SIlist{+150}{-150}{\mV}}$ for the entire range of simulated ionic strengths
(\cref{fig:potential_energy_radial_averages}). The resulting energy plot represents the energy
landscape---filled with barriers (hills) or traps (valleys)---that a positive or negative ion must traverse in
order to contribute positively to (\ie~increase) the ionic current.

At positive bias voltages, cations traverse the pore from \transi{} to \cisi{}
(\cref{fig:potential_energy_radial_averages}, first plot). Upon entering the negatively charged constriction,
their electrostatic energy drops dramatically, followed by a relatively flat section with a small barrier for
entry in the \lumeni{} at $z \approx \text{\SI{1.6}{\nm}}$. At very low ionic strengths ($\cbulk <
\text{\SI{0.05}{\Molar}}$), the energy at \transi{} is significantly lower than the energy of the cation in
the \cisi{} compartment (\eg~$\Delta\radenergy > \text{\SI{2}{\kT}}$ at \SI{0.005}{\Molar}), forcing the ions
to accumulate inside the pore. At higher concentrations ($\cbulk > \text{\SI{0.05}{\Molar}}$), the increased
screening smooths out the potential drop inside the pore, allowing the cations to migrate unhindered across
the entire length of the pore. Anions at $\vbias = \text{\SI{+150}{\mV}}$ travel from \cisi{} to \transi{}
(\cref{fig:potential_energy_radial_averages}, second plot) and must overcome energy barriers at both sides of
the pore. The former prevents anions such as \Cl{} from entering the pore. However, because its magnitude is
attenuated strongly with increasing salt concentration (from \SI{\approx1.7}{\kT} at $\cbulk =
\text{\SI{0.005}{\Molar}}$ to \SI{\approx0.5}{\kT} at $\cbulk = \text{\SI{0.05}{\Molar}}$), it is only
relevant at lower ionic strengths ($\cbulk < \text{\SI{0.05}{\Molar}}$). Once inside the \lumeni{}, anions can
move relatively unencumbered to the \transi{} constriction, where they face the second, more significant
energy barrier. This prevents them from fully translocating and causes them to accumulate inside the lumen,
explaining the higher \Cl{} concentrations at positive bias voltages.
% Anions that do pass the final barrier are rewarded with a large reduction of their electrostatic energy, as
% the bulk of the voltage drop occurs only after the \transi{} constriction.
As with the cations, an increase in the ionic strength significantly reduces
these hurdles, resulting in a much smoother landscape for $\cbulk > \text{\SI{0.15}{\Molar}}$.

At negative voltages, cations move through the pore from \cisi{} to \transi{}, with a slow and continuous drop
of the electrostatic energy throughout the \lumeni{} of the pore up until the constriction
(\cref{fig:potential_energy_radial_averages}, third plot). This results in the efficient removal of cations
from the pore \lumeni{}, and explains the lower \Na{} concentration observed at positive voltages
(\cref{fig:concentration_pore_average_vs_cbulk}). To fully exit from the pore, however, cations must overcome
a large energy barrier, which reduces the nanopore's ability to conduct cations compared to positive
potentials and hence contributes to the ion current rectification. The situation for anions at negative bias
voltages (\ie~travelling from \transi{} to \cisi{}) is very different
(\cref{fig:potential_energy_radial_averages}, fourth plot). Their ability to even enter the pore is severely
hampered by an energy barrier of a few \si{\kT} at the \transi{} constriction. Any anions that do cross this
barrier, and those still present in the \lumeni{} of ClyA, will be rapidly move towards the \cisi{} entry and
exit from the pore due to a continuous drop of electrostatic energy. This effectively depletes the entire
\lumeni{} of anions, which can be observed from the much lower \Cl{} concentrations at negative voltages
(see~\cref{fig:concentration_pore_average_vs_cbulk}).

\paragraph{Concentration and voltage dependencies of the energy barrier at the constriction.}
%
Many biological nanopores contain constrictions that play crucial roles in shaping their ionic conductance
properties.\cite{Maglia-2008,Franceschini-2016,Huang-2017} The reason for this is two-fold, 1) the narrowest
part dominates the overall resistance of the pore and 2) confinement of charged residues results in much
larger electrostatic energy barriers. With its highly negatively charged \transi{} constriction, ClyA's
affinity for transport of anions is diminished and that for cations is enhanced compared to bulk, even at high
ionic strengths (\cref{fig:transport_number_vs_concentration_bulk_pnp_epnp}).\cite{Soskine-2013} To further
elucidate the significance of the \transi{} electrostatic barrier ($\deltaEt$), we quantified its height at
positive and negative voltages as a function of the salt concentration
(\cref{fig:potential_energy_trans_barrier}).

Due to the tilting of the energy landscape, the application of a bias voltage lowers the magnitude of the
energy barrier for all conditions. Likewise, increasing the bulk salt concentration results in a continuous
decrease of $\deltaEt$. For $\cbulk > \text{\SI{0.5}{\Molar}}$, $\deltaEt$ falls below \SI{1}{\kT} regardless
of the bias voltage, reducing its effect on the ion transport through the pore. The barrier heights for ions
under the influence of a positive bias voltage (\ie~\Na{} moving from \transi{} to \cisi{} and \Cl{} moving
from \cisi{} to \transi{}), experience a $\deltaEt$ roughly half that of those under a negative voltage. For
example, upon increasing the salt concentration from \SIrange{0.005}{0.15}{\Molar}, $\deltaEt$ dropped from
\SIrange{1.8}{0.73}{\kT} at $\vbias = \text{\SI{+150}{\mV}}$ and from \SIrange{4.4}{1.5}{\kT} at $\vbias =
\text{\SI{-150}{\mV}}$. This explains the differences in ion selectivity observed between positive and
negative bias voltages (\cref{fig:transport_number_vs_concentration_bulk_pnp_epnp}). At $\cbulk =
\text{\SI{0.15}{\Molar}}$, for example, the ion selectivity $\transportn_{\Na}$ increases from \num{0.79} at
$\vbias = \text{\SI{+150}{\mV}}$ to \num{0.88} at $\vbias = \text{\SI{-150}{\mV}}$.

The charged nature of many nanopores gives rise to a net flux of water through the pore, called the
electro-osmotic flow (EOF).\cite{Qiao-Aluru-2003,Thompson-2003,Mao-2014} The EOF not only contributes
significantly to the ionic current, but the magnitude of the viscous drag force it exerts is often of the same
order as the Coulombic electrophoretic force (EPF). Hence, it strongly influences the capture and
translocation of biomolecules including nucleic acids,\cite{Wong-2007,Luan-2008,Firnkes-2010}
peptides,\cite{Huang-2017,Li-2018,Huang-2019} and
proteins.\cite{Soskine-2012,Soskine-2013,VanMeervelt-2014,Soskine-Biesemans-2015,Biesemans-Soskine-2015,Wloka-2017,Galenkamp-2018,Willems-Ruic-Biesemans-2019}
Because the drag exerted by the EOF depends primarily on the size and shape of the biomolecule of interest and
not on its charge,\cite{Willems-Ruic-Biesemans-2019} it can be employed to capture molecules even against the
electric field.\cite{Soskine-2012} The EOF is a consequence of interaction between the fixed charges on the
nanopore walls and mobile charges in the electrolyte. It can be described by two closely related mechanisms:
1) the excess transport of the hydration shell water molecules in one direction due to the pore's ion
selectivity, and 2) the viscous drag exerted by the unidirectional movement of the electrical double layer
inside the pore. The first mechanism likely dominates in pores with a diameter close to that of the hydrated
ions (\SI{\le1}{\nm}) such as \ahl{} or FraC,\cite{Huang-2017,Huang-2019} while the second is expected to be
stronger for larger pores (\SI{>1}{\nm}), such as ClyA\cite{Soskine-2012,Willems-Ruic-Biesemans-2019} or most
solid-state nanopores.\cite{Mao-2014,Laohakunakorn-2015} In our simulation, the EOF follows the coupling of
the Navier-Stokes and the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations through a volume force term
(\cref{eq:ion_force_density}), which dictates that the electric field exerts a net force on the fluid if it
contains a net charge density---as is the case for the electrical double layer lining the walls of ClyA
(\cref{fig:ion_charge_dist_vs_cbulk}). In the following section we aim to quantitatively and a qualitatively
describe the properties of the water velocity inside ClyA and how it is influenced by the bulk ionic strength
and the applied bias voltage (\cref{fig:flow}).


\paragraph{Direction, magnitude and distribution of the water velocity.}
%
As expected, given ClyA's negatively charged interior surface and the resulting positively charged electrical
double layer, the direction of the net water flow inside ClyA follows the electric field, \ie~from the \cisi{}
to the \transi{} at negative bias voltages (\cref{fig:flow_contour}). This corresponds to the observations and
analysis of single-molecule protein capture\cite{Soskine-2013} and
trapping\cite{Soskine-Biesemans-2015,Biesemans-Soskine-2015,Willems-Ruic-Biesemans-2019} experiments using the
ClyA-AS nanopore. Along the longitudinal axis ($z$) of the pore, the water velocity is governed by the
conservation of mass, meaning it is lowest in the wide \cisi{} \textit{lumen} and highest in the narrow
\transi{} constriction (\cref{fig:flow_contour}). For example, at $\vbias = \text{\SI{-100}{\mV}}$ and $\cbulk
= \text{\SI{0.5}{\Molar}}$ the velocity at the center of the pore is \SI{\approx0.07}{\mps} in the
\textit{lumen} and \SI{\approx0.21}{\mps} in the constriction.

Along the radial axis ($r$), $\velocity$ has a parabolic profile with the highest value at the center of the
pore and the lowest at the wall due to the no-slip boundary condition
(\cref{fig:flow_constriction_contour,fig:flow_constriction_profiles}). Such a parabolic profile contrasts the
expected `plug flow' for an EOF, but follows logically from the overlap of the electrical double layer inside
the pore and the resulting uniform volume force---analogous to a gravity- or pressure-driven Stokes flow. At
concentrations higher than \SI{0.5}{\Molar}, however, the increasing degree of confinement of the double
layer---and its charge---to the nanopore walls
(see~\cref{fig:ion_charge_dist_vs_cbulk}, $\pav{\Qion}{s}$) results in a flattening
of the central maximum and hence a plug flow profile. Interestingly, at very high salt concentrations ($\cbulk
\ge \text{\SI{1}{\Molar}}$) the velocity profile in the constriction exhibits a dimple at the center of the
pore. This is the result of a self-induced pressure gradient caused by the expansion of the EOF as it exits
the pore.\cite{Melnikov-2017}

\paragraph{Influence of bulk ionic strength and bias voltage on the electro-osmotic conductance.}
%
In analogy to the ionic conductance, the amount of water transported by ClyA can be expressed by the
electro-osmotic conductance $\flowcond = \flowrate / \vbias$ (\cref{fig:flow_conductance_vs_concentration}).
Here, $\flowrate$ is the net volumetric flow rate of water through the pore and computed by integrating the
water velocity across the reservoir boundary (\cref{eq:flowrate}). The strength of the EOF depends strongly
and non-monotonically on the bulk ionic strength: $\flowcond$ rapidly increases with ionic strength until a
peak value is reached at $\cbulk \approx \text{\SI{0.5}{\Molar}}$, followed by a gradual logarithmic decline
(\cref{fig:flow_conductance_vs_concentration}). For example, at $\vbias = \text{\SI{-150}{\mV}}$, $\flowcond$
changes from \SIlist[list-final-separator = { to }]{1.85;11.3;4.00}{\cubic\nm\per\ns\per\volt} at for $\cbulk
= \text{\SIlist{0.005;0.5;5}{\Molar}}$, respectively.

The sensitivity of the EOF to the magnitude and sign of the bias voltage is given by the electro-osmotic
conductance rectification $\eor(V) = \flowcond (+V) / \flowcond (-V)$
(\cref{fig:flow_conductance_rectification_vs_concentration}). For all voltages magnitudes, $\eor$ shows a
maximum at $\cbulk \approx \text{\SI{0.045}{\Molar}}$, after which it falls rapidly to reach unity ($\eor =
1$) at approximately $\cbulk \approx \text{\SI{0.45}{\Molar}}$. A minimum is then reached at
\SI{\approx1}{\Molar}, followed by a gradual approach towards unity at $\cbulk = \text{\SI{5}{\Molar}}$.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

We have developed an extended version of the Poison-Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes (ePNP-NS) equations and used
it to model the transport of ions and water through the biological nanopore ClyA. Our ePNP-NS equations
combine many of the improvements to the PNP-NS equations available in literature, in addition to several new
corrections. These include the finite size of the ions, self-consistent concentration- and
positional-dependent parametrization of the ionic transport coefficients (diffusion coefficient and mobility)
and of the electrolyte properties (density, viscosity and relative permittivity).

We have verified our approach by matching experimental results to a very high degree of accuracy and the model
parameters where gauged on other experiments, ultimately leaving no degrees of freedom. This shows that a
continuum approach to modeling biological nanopores is not only feasible but to a very high degree predictive.
We are confident that such a model as presented in this paper, constitutes a highly practical tool that can
help with 1) elucidating the link between ionic current observed during a nanopore experiment and the actual
physical phenomenon, 2) describing the electrophoretic and electro-osmotic properties of any biological
nanopore and 3) guiding the design of new variants of existing nanopores.

In the analysis of the operation of ClyA with our model we found that the ionic currents depend strongly on
the details of the electric field structure within the pore which define potential barriers for the ion
species. These barriers in turn are influenced by both the bulk ionic strength and the applied bias voltage.
Nevertheless, despite its simplified 2D-axisymmetric nature, our model is able to obtain meaningful and
predictive results in terms of the ionic current, the ion concentrations, the electrostatic potential and
electro-osmotic flow velocity. Some inaccuracies still arise at low salt concentrations, but these can likely
be resolved with an improved mobility model.

Although not explicitly investigated in the current work, there are no obvious reasons why the model framework
is not directly applicable to other biological nanopores, solid-state nanopores and other nanoscale ionic
transport problems. These systems can be treated analogously and their properties could be mapped out
systematically using our ePNP-NS model, greatly enhancing the understanding and interpretation of experimental
results.

\section{Materials and Methods}\label{sec:methods}

\paragraph{ClyA-AS homology model.}
%
A full atom model of ClyA-AS\cite{Soskine-2013} was built and optimized (MODELLER v9.18\cite{Sali-1993}) by
introduction of the following point mutations in each of the 12 chains of the wild-type ClyA crystal structure
(PDBID: 2WCD\cite{Mueller-2009}): K8Q, N15S, Q38K, A57G, T67V, C87A, A90V, A95S, L99Q, E103G, K118R, L119I,
I124V, T125K, V136T, F166Y, K172R, V185I, K212N, K214R, S217T, T224S, N227A, T244A, E276G, C285S, K290Q. Next,
the conformation of all mutated side chains was optimized with an double annealing protocol (heating: 150,
250, 400, 700 and \SI{1000}{\kelvin}, cooling: 1000, 800, 600, 500, 400 and \SI{300}{\kelvin}) where at each
temperature the energy was minimized for 200 iterations with a conjugate gradients algorithm (\SI{4}{\fs}
timestep).\cite{Shanno-1980} The first anneal was performed solely on the mutated residues themselves, and the
second run also took the non-bonded interactions with the neighboring atoms into account. The refined nanopore
structure was then embedded in the center of an \SI{18x18}{\nm} equilibrated DPhPC lipid bilayer patch by
manual removal of all overlapping lipids, resulting in 463 lipid molecules. The bilayer was created with the
CHARMM-GUI\cite{Jo-2008} membrane builder\cite{Lee-2016} and equilibrated with NAMD\cite{Phillips-2005}, as
described in detail in ref.~[\citenum{Wu-2014}]. The system was then solvated in a box of \SI{18x18x32}{\nm}
by addition of 214640 TIP3 water molecules (VMD solvate plugin), and the global charge was neutralized by
replacing 1276 random water molecules with 674 \Na{} and 602 \Cl{} ions (VMD autoionize
plugin).\cite{Humphrey-1996}

\paragraph{Molecular dynamics simulations.}
%
Using molecular dynamics (MD) with NAMD 2.12 (\SI{2}{\fs} timestep, CHARMM36 forcefield\cite{Best-2012}), the
final system was minimized for \SI{5}{\ps}, heated from 0 to \SI{298.15}{\kelvin} in \SI{4}{\ps} and
equilibrated for \SI{4}{\ns} as NpT ensemble.\cite{Aksimentiev-2005} Finally a \SI{30}{\ns} production run
was performed using a NVT ensemble at \SI{298.15}{\kelvin} and the atomic coordinates saved every \SI{5}{\ps}.
Note that structural deterioration was prevented by harmonically restraining the protein's C$_\alpha$ atoms to
their original positions (spring constant of \SI{695}{\pN\per\nm}) during all MD runs.\cite{Bhattacharya-2011}

\paragraph{Axially symmetric geometry.}
%
The 2D-axisymmetric geometry of the ClyA-AS nanopore (\cref{fig:model_geometry_vs_wedge}) was derived directly
from its full atom model by radially averaging the molecular density. Briefly, 50 sets of atomic coordinates
were extracted from the final \SI{5}{\ns} of the coordinates of the \SI{30}{\ns} MD production run
(\ie~every \SI{100}{\fs}) and aligned by minimizing the RMSD between their backbone atoms (VMD RMSD tool).
Next, we computed and averaged the 3D-dimensional molecular density maps of all 50 structures on a
\SI{0.5}{\angstrom} resolution grid using the Gaussian function\cite{Li-2013}
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:denspore}
  \rho_\text{mol} = 1 - \displaystyle\prod_{i} \left[ 1 - 
    \exp{\left(-\dfrac{-d_i^2}{(\stdev\atomradius_{i})^2}\right)} \right]
    \text{\,,}
\end{align}
%
where for each atom $i$, $R_i$ is its Van der Waals radius, $d_i=\sqrt{(x-x_i)^2 + (y-y_i)^2 + (z-z_i)^2}$ is
the distance of grid coordinates $(x, y, z)$ from the atom center $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ and $\stdev = 0.93$ is a
width factor. The resulting 3D density map was then radially averaged along the z-axis, relative to the center
of the pore to obtain a 2D-axisymmetric density map. The contourline at \SI{25}{\percent} density was used as
the nanopore simulation geometry, after manual removal of overlapping and superfluous vertices to improve the
quality of the final computational mesh.

\paragraph{Axially symmetric charge density.}
%
The 2D-axially symmetric charge distribution (\cref{fig:model_charge_density} was also derived directly from
the 50 sets of aligned nanopore coordinates) that were used for the geometry. Inspired by how charges are
represented in the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method,\cite{Aksimentiev-2005} we computed the fixed charge
distribution of the nanopore $\scdpore(r,z)$ by assuming that an atom $i$ of partial charge
$\partialcharge_{i}$, at the location $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ in the full 3D atomistic pore model, contributes an
amount $\partialcharge_{i}/2\pi r_i$ to the partial charge at a point $(r_i,z_i)$ with $r_i = \sqrt{x_i^2 +
y_i^2}$ in the averaged 2D-axisymmetric model. This effectively spreads the charge over all angles to achieve
axial symmetry. We assumed a Gaussian distribution of the space charge density of each atom $i$
around its respective 2D-axisymmetric coordinates $(r_i,z_i)$ is
%
\begin{align}
\label{eq:scdpore}
  \scdpore(r,z) = \dsum_{i} \dfrac{\echarge\partialcharge_{i}}{\pi(\stdev\atomradius_{i})^2}
            \exp{\left(-\dfrac{(r-r_i)^2 + (z-z_i)^2}{(\stdev\atomradius_{i})^2}\right)}
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
%
where $\atomradius_{i}$ is the atom radius, $\sigma = \num{0.5}$ is the sharpness factor and $\echarge$ is the
elementary charge. To embed $\scdpore$ with sufficient detail, yet efficiently, into a numeric solver, the
spatial coordinates were discretized with a grid spacing of $0.005$~nm in the domain of $\scdpore$ and
precomputed values were used during the solver runtime. All partial charges (at pH~7.5) and radii were taken
from the CHARMM36 forcefield\cite{Best-2012} and assigned using PROPKA\cite{Olsson-2011} and
PBD2PQR.\cite{Jurrus-2018}

\paragraph{Computing electrophoretic mobilities.}
%
To obtain the concentration-dependent ionic mobility  $\mobility^c_{i}$ from fitted functions, it must first
be derived from the salt's molar conductivity $\molarconductivity$ and the ion's transport number
$\transportn_{i}$ before it can be fitted\cite{ContrerasAburto-2013-1}
%
\begin{align}
\label{eq:conductivity-to-mobility}
  \mobility_{i}(\concentration) = \frac{\specmolarconductivity_{i}(\concentration)}{\chargen_{i}\faraday}
  \quad\text{with}\quad \specmolarconductivity_{i}(\concentration) = \molarconductivity(\concentration)
  \transportn_{i}(\concentration)
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
%
where $\specmolarconductivity_{i}(\concentration)$ is the specific molar conductivity of ion $i$.

\paragraph{Computing the simulated ionic current and electro-osmotic flow rate.}
%
The simulated ionic current $\currentsim$ at steady-state was computed by
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:currentsim}
  \currentsim = \faraday\int_{S}\left(\dsum_{i}\chargen_{i}\normvec\cdot\vec{\flux}_{i}\right)dS
  \text{\,,}
\end{align}
%
with $\chargen_{i}$ the charge number and $\vec{\flux}_{i}$ the total flux of each ion $i$ across \cis{}
reservoir boundary $S$, $\faraday$ the Faraday constant (\SI{96485}{\coulomb\per\mole}) and $\normvec$ the
unit vector normal to $S$. Similarly, the volumetric flow rate, \ie~the volume of water passing through the pore per unit time, is given by
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:flowrate}
  \flowrate = \int_{S}\left(\dsum_{i}\normvec\cdot\vec{\velocity}\right)dS
  \text{\,.}
\end{align}
%

\paragraph{ClyA expression and purification.}
%
ClyA-AS monomers were expressed, purified and oligomerized using methods described in detail
elsewhere.\cite{Soskine-2012,Soskine-2013} Briefly, \textit{E. cloni} EXPRESS BL21 (DE3) cells (Lucigen
Corporation, Middleton, USA) were transformed with a pT7 plasmid containing the ClyA-AS gene, followed by
overexpression after induction with $1$~mM isopropyl \textbeta{}-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich,
Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). The ClyA monomers were purified using \ce{Ni+}-NTA affinity chromatography and
oligomerized by incubation in $0.2$~\%\ D-maltoside n-dodecyl-\textbeta{}-D-maltopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich,
Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) for 30~minutes at 37\textdegree C. Pure ClyA-AS type-I (12-mer) nanopores were
obtained using native PAGE on a $4$-$15$\%\ gradient gel (Bio-Rad, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) and subsequent
excision of the correct oligomer band.

\paragraph{Recording of single-channel current-voltage curves.}
%
Experimental current-voltage curves where measured using single-channel electrophysiology, as detailed
elsewhere.\cite{Maglia-2010,Soskine-2012,Soskine-2013} Briefly, a black lipid bilayer was inside a
\SI{\approx100}{\um} diameter aperture in a thin teflon film separating two buffered electrolyte compartments
by painting with 1,2-diphytanoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhPC, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, USA).
Minute amounts ($\approx$) of the purified ClyA-AS type I oligomer were then added to the grounded \cis{}
reservoir and allowed to insert into the lipid bilayer. Single-channel current-voltage curves were recorded
using a custom pulse protocol of the Clampex 10.4 software package connected to AxoPatch 200B patch-clamp
amplifier via a Digidata 1440A digitizer (all from Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA). Data was acquired at
$10$~kHz and filtered using a $2$-kHz low bandpass filter. Measurements at different ionic strengths were
performed at $\approx25$\textdegree C in aqueous \ce{NaCl} solutions, buffered at pH~$7.5$ using $10$~mM MOPS
(Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht,The Netherlands).
