Cytolysin A (ClyA) is a protein nanopore that has become a valuable tool for the detection, characterization
and analysis of bio-markers, proteins and nucleic acids at the single-molecule level.  While ClyA has been
engineered extensively towards these applications, a full understanding of its transport properties and the
scale of the electrophoretic forces inside it, is currently lacking. From this perspective, we have built a
2D-axisymmetric model of ClyA that accurately captures its geometry and charge distribution, and numerically
computed the flux of ions and water through the pore. To achieve the latter, we developed an extended version
of the steady-state Poison-Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes (ePNP-NS) equations that makes use of self-consistent
concentration- and positional-dependencies for the ion diffusion coefficients and mobilities, and the solvent
density, viscosity and relative permittivity. In this study we show that our model, in conjunction with the
ePNP-NS equations, is able to reproduce the experimentally observed ionic currents over a wide range of ionic
strengths and applied voltages. We further describe the influence of these latter two parameters on various
quantities of interest, including the cation and anion concentrations inside the pore, the shape of the
electrostatic potential landscape and the magnitude and direction of the electro-osmotic flow.

\section{Introduction}

The transport of ions and molecules through nanoscale geometries is a field of intense study using both
experimental, theoretical and computational methods.\cite{Sparreboom-2010,Bocquet-2010,Maffeo-2012,
Thomas-2014,Wang-2014,Kim-2015} One of the primary driving forces behind this research is the development of
nanopores as label-free, stochastic sensors at the ultimate analytical limit.\cite{Bayley-2001,
Dekker-2007,Venkatesan-2011,Zhang-2016} Such detectors have applications ranging from the analysis of
biopolymers, i.e. DNA\cite{Deamer-2016,Kasianowicz-1996,Meller-2000,Maglia-2008,Butler-2008,Stoddart-2009,
Franceschini-2013,Jain-2018} or proteins\cite{Restrepo-Perez-2018,Talaga-2009,Rodriguez-Larrea-2013,
Nivala-2013,Kennedy-2016}, to the detection and quantification of biomarkers,\cite{Chen-2013,Soskine-2012,
Niedzwiecki-2013,VanMeervelt-2014,Huang-2017,Liu-2018,Galenkamp-2018}, to the fundamental study of chemical or
enzymatic reactions at the single molecular level.\cite{Willems-VanMeervelt-2017,Lieberman-2010,
Nivala-2013,Ho-2015,Laszlo-2017}

Nanopores are generally operated in the `resistive-pulse' mode, where fluctuations of their ionic conductance
are monitored over time.\cite{Bayley-2001,Dekker-2007,Maglia-2010,Venkatesan-2011} This conductance is
measured by placing the nanopore between two electrolyte compartments and applying a constant DC (or AC)
voltage ($0.001-1$~V) across them. Due to the high resistance of the nanopore, virtually the full potential
change occurs near and within the pore, resulting in a strong electrical field ($10^7$--$10^8$~mV~nm$^{-1}$)
that electrophoretically drives ions and water molecules, if the pore is charged, through the
pore.\cite{Wong-2007,Mao-2014,Haywood-2014,Laohakunakorn-2015} Hence, analyte molecules such as DNA or
proteins are driven towards the nanopore by a combination of coulombic (`electrophoretic') and hydrodynamic
(`electro-osmostic') forces, after which they attempt to translocate through the
pore.\cite{Wong-2007,Grosberg-2010,Muthukumar-2010,Muthukumar-2014} Such a translocation is observed as a
temporal fluctuation in the ionic conductance of the pore and serves as a unique molecular `fingerprint' with
which the molecule can be identified.\cite{Yusko-2017} The frequency, magnitude, duration and even noise
levels of these events depend on the properties of both the analyte molecule and the nanopore itself, making
them notoriously difficult to interpret efficiently without a full understanding of the nanofluidic phenomena
that underline them.

The computational methods used most widely to study nanofluidic transport in ion channels or biological
nanopores comprise molecular dynamics (MD),\cite{Lynden-Bell-1996,Allen-1999,Aksimentiev-2005,Luan-2008,
Bhattacharya-2011,Zhang-2014,DiMarino-2015,Belkin-2016} Brownian dynamics (BD),\cite{Schirmer-1999,Im-2002,
Noskov-2004,Millar-2008,Egwolf-2010,DeBiase-2015,Pederson-2015} and the coupled Poisson, Nernst--Planck and
Navier--Stokes (PNP-NS) equations\cite{Simakov-2010,Pederson-2015,Hsu-2017b,Gillespie-2002}. The latter are of
particular interest due to their low computational cost and  analytical tractability. However, great care must
be taken when using the PNP-NS equations for ion channels and small nanopores due to the breakdown of the
continuum assumption below $\approx5$~nm for fluids, the neglect of the short-range inter-molecular
interactions and the absence of excluded volume effects.\cite{Corry-2000,Collins-2012} Nevertheless, the PNP
equations have been used extensively for the simulation of ion channels,\cite{Im-2002,Furini-2006,Liu-2015}
biological nanopores,\cite{Simakov-2010,Pederson-2015} and their solid-state counterparts,\cite{Cervera-2005,
White-2008,Chaudhry-2014,Laohakunakorn-2015} often with excellent qualitative -- if not quantitative --
results.\cite{Maffeo-2012,Thomas-2014,Kim-2015}

To overcome the limitations plaguing the continuum theories, a multitude of modifications the PNP theory have
been proposed over the years.\cite{Bazant-2009,Daiguji-2010} One such an improvement concerns the excess in
chemical potential caused by the finite size of the ions.\cite{Eisenberg-1996} In one approach, Gillespie et
al. successfully predicted the selectivity and current of ion channels by coupling the PNP equations with
density functional theory.\cite{Gillespie-2002} To qualitatively account for finite ion-size effects, Kilic et
al. derived a set of modified PNP equations\cite{Kilic-2007} -- based on the free energy functional of the
Borukhov's modified Poison--Boltzman (PB) model\cite{Borukhov-1997} -- and observed significantly more
realistic concentration for high surface potentials compared to the classical PNP equations. This model was
later extened by Lu et al. to allow for non-identical ion sizes and more than two ion species, and used to
investigate the effect of finite ion size on the rate coefficients of enzymes.\cite{Lu-2011}

A second refinement aims to take into account the reduction in ion and water motility in close proximity to
proteins, as observed in MD simulations.\cite{Makarov-1998} Such a positional-dependent ion diffusion
coefficient implemented -- to predict the ionic conductance of the $\textalpha$-hemolysin nanopore -- in a BD
simulation by Noskov et al.\cite{Noskov-2004} and in a PNP framework by Simakov and
Kurnikova.\cite{Simakov-2010} Similar reductions in ion diffusion coefficients have been proposed to improve
the ionic current of ion channels as calculated with PNP theory.\cite{Furini-2006,Liu-2015} For water
molecules, the reduced mobility at the solid-liquid interface leads to viscosities several times higher
compared to the bulk values. Such increased viscosities were observed with MD simulations for water molecules
near proteins\cite{Pronk-2014} and confined in hydrophilic nanopores.\cite{Vo-2016,Hsu-2017} Note that for
hydrophobic interfaces such as carbon nanotubes, the effects are likely to be reversed.\cite{Ye-2011}

A third improvement concerns the effect of a non-dilute ionic strength on the transport coefficients of ions.
The self-diffusion coefficient $\diffusion_{i}$ and electrophoretic mobility $\mobility_{i}$ of an ion $i$
generally decreases significantly with increasing salt concentration. Moreover, the well-known Nernst-Einstein
(NE) relation $\mobility_{i}=\diffusion_{i}/\kT$ -- while valid at infinite dilution and a good approximation
at low concentrations ($<10$~mM) -- significantly overestimates the the ionic mobility at at higher salt
concentrations.\cite{Mills-1989,Panopoulos-1986,ContrerasAburto-2013-1,ContrerasAburto-2013-2} In an emperical
approach, Baldessari and Santiago formulated an ionic-strength dependency of the ionic mobility based on their
activity coefficients\cite{Baldessari-2008-1} and showed excellent correspondence between the experimental and
simulated ionic conductance of long nanochannels over a wide concentration range.\cite{Baldessari-2008-2}
Alternatively, Burger et al. used a microscopic lattice-based model to derive a set of PNP equations with
non-linear, ion density-dependent mobilities and diffusion coefficients that provided significantly more
realistic results for ion channels.\cite{Burger-2012}

To the best of our knowledge, no attempt to consolidate the most salient corrections into a single framework
has been made to date. Hence, we propose such a framework in the form of an extended set of PNP-NS (ePNP-NS)
equations, which improves the predictive power of the PNP-NS equations at the nanoscale and beyond infinite
dilution. Our ePNP-NS model takes the finite size of the ions into account using a size-modified PNP
theory,\cite{Lu-2011} and implements spatial-dependencies for the solvent viscosity,\cite{Pronk-2014,
Hsu-2017} the ion diffusion coefficients and their mobilities.\cite{Makarov-1998,Noskov-2004} Finally, we also
included self-consistent concentration-dependent properties for both the ions -- in terms of diffusion
coefficients and mobilities\cite{Baldessari-2008-1,Mills-1989} -- and the solvent -- in terms of density,
viscosity\cite{Hai-Lang-1996} and relative permittivity\cite{Gavish-2016}.

Next, we applied the ePNP-NS equations to a computationally inexpensive -- yet highly realistic in terms of geometry and charge distribution -- 2D-axisymmetric continuum model of the biological nanopore Cytolysin A (ClyA).\cite{Soskine-2012,Soskine-2013} While this pore has been extensively used in experimental studies of both proteins\cite{Soskine-2013,VanMeervelt-2014,Soskine-Biesemans-2015,Biesemans-Soskine-2015,Wloka-2017,
VanMeervelt-2017,Galenkamp-2018} and DNA,\cite{Franceschini-2013,Franceschini-2016} no computational work is currently available that describes the ion concentrations inside the pore, the distribution of the electrostatic potential and the magnitude of the electro-osmotic flow -- quantities of interest that are generally difficult to determine experimentally.

We begin our study of ClyA by describing its conductance, rectification and ion selectivity over a wide
range of salt concentrations and voltages, and use experimental data to benchmark the accuracy of our ePNP-NS framework. This is followed by a detailed description of the concentration of cations and anions inside the pore and the ionic charge density resulting from their imbalance. Next we describe ClyA's the electrostatic potential landscape and link the magnitude of it's peaks and valleys to the ionic current rectification and ion selectivity. We conclude with a characterization of the concentration and voltage dependency of electro-osmotic flow.

\section{Results and discussion}\label{sect:results}

\subsection{Model and equations}

\input{fig_model_concept.tex}

\paragraph{A 2D-axisymmetric continuum model of ClyA-AS.}
ClyA is a relatively large protein nanopore that self-assembles on lipid bilayers to form $14$~nm long
hydrophilic channels. The interior of the pore can be divided into roughly two cylindrical compartments
(\cref{fig:clya_side}): the \cis\ lumen ($\approx6$~nm diameter, $\approx10$~nm height), and the \trans\
constriction ($\approx3.3$~nm diameter, $\approx4$~nm height). Because ClyA consists of $>10$ identical
subunits (\cref{fig:clya_top}), it exhibits a high degree of radial symmetry --- a geometrical feature allows
to obtain meaningful results at low computational cost by reduction of the full 3D structure to a much more
computationally efficient 2D-axisymmetric model.\cite{Pederson-2015,Lu-2012}

The nanopore's 2D-axisymmetric geometry (\cref{fig:model_geometry_vs_wedge}) was obtained by radially
averaging the molecular surface definition of a full-atom homology model of ClyA-AS. The 2D charge density
distribution (\cref{fig:model_charge_density}) was constructed by projecting the partial charges of all atoms,represented by 2D-Gaussian functions, onto a plane. To ensure that our model accurately portraits the
steady-state behavior of the ClyA-AS, we averaged the geometry and charge maps over $\approx50$ full-atom
structures, extracted from the last $5$~ns (i.e. every $100$~ps) of a $30$~ns explicit solvent molecular
dynamics simulation (cfr. M\&M for details). In the simulation geometry
(\cref{fig:model_geometry_zoom,fig:model_geometry}), the nanopore is located at the center of a large
spherical electrolyte reservoir ($R=250$~nm), which is split into two hemispherical compartments by a lipid
bilayer ($h=2.8$~nm). Because the boundaries of the nanopore and the bilayer are impermeable, transport of
water and ions must occur through the nanopore.

\paragraph{Extended Poisson-Nernst-Planck Navier-Stokes equations.}

% Nanofluidics

To describe the ion and water transport mechanisms within ClyA, we created a computational model of the fluid
based on a set of well-known partial-differential equations called the coupled
Poisson--Nernst--Planck and Navier--Stokes (PNP-NS) equations.

While these equations have proven to be excellent tool for studying ion and water transport in both
solid-state\cite{Daiguji-2004,Lu-2012,Chaudhry-2014,Rempfer-2016,Lin-2016} and biological
nanopores\cite{Eisenberg-1996,Simakov-2010,Pederson-2015}, the underlying continuum assumption does not hold
at the nanoscale ($r_{\text{pore}}<1$~nm) under all circumstances, particularly at material
interfaces\cite{Vo-2016} and in regions of high charge density\cite{Corry-2000}. To address these concerns
and to improve the accuracy of our model, we propose a modified version of these equations, that we will
refer to as extended PNP-NS (ePNP-NS), which takes into account the finite size of the
ions\cite{Borukhov-1997,Lu-2011} and the reduction of ion and water mobility near protein
interfaces.\cite{Makarov-1998, Pronk-2014} Because the diffusion coefficients\cite{Mills-1989},
mobilities\cite{Baldessari-2008-2}, viscosity\cite{Hai-Lang-1996}, density\cite{Hai-Lang-1996} and relative
permittivity\cite{Gavish-2016} deviate significantly from the traditional `infinite dilution' values at
experimentally relevant concentrations, we implemented a self-consistent dependency on the average ion
concentration for all these parameters.

The final set of equations consist of the Poisson equation to compute the electrostatics\cite{Lu-2012}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:poisson}
  \nabla \cdot \left(\absperm \relperm \nabla \potential \right) = -\left( \scdpore + \scdion \right)
  \text{ ,}
\end{align}
with $\potential$ the electric potential, $\absperm$ the vacuum permittivity
($8.85419\times10^{-12}\text{~F\,m}^{-1}$), and $\relperm$ the local relative permittivity of the medium.
$\scdpore$ and $\scdion$ are the fixed (due to the pore) and mobile (due to the ions) charge distributions,
respectively. $\relperm$ is equal to
\begin{align}
  \relperm =
  \begin{cases}
    \relperm^0, & \text{for PNP-NS} \\
    \relperm^0 \relperm^c(\dconc) & \text{for ePNP-NS}
  \end{cases}\notag
  \text{ ,}
\end{align}
The the ionic fluxes $\flux_{i}$ were computed with the size-modified Nernst-Planck equation\cite{Lu-2012}
\begin{multline}
  \label{eq:smnp}
  \nabla\cdot\flux_{i} = \nabla \cdot
  \left(
    \diffusion_{i}\nabla\concentration_{i}
    + \chargen_{i}\mobility_{i} \concentration_{i} \nabla\potential \right. \\
    \left.
    + \vec{\beta_{i}} \concentration_{i}
    - \velocity \concentration_{i}
  \right)
\end{multline}
with ion diffusion coefficient $\diffusion_{i}$, concentration $\concentration_{i}$, charge number
$\chargen_{i}$, mobility $\mobility_{i}$, electrostatic potential $\potential$, steric saturation factor
$\beta_{i}$ and fluid velocity $\velocity$. The values of $\diffusion_{i}$, $\mobility_{i}$ and $\beta_{i}$ are
\begin{align}
  \diffusion_{i} =
  \begin{cases}
    \diffusion_{i}^0, & \text{for PNP-NS} \\
    \diffusion_{i}^0 \diffusion_{i}^c(\dconc) \diffusion_{i}^w\left(\dwall\right)& \text{for ePNP-NS,}
  \end{cases}\notag \\
  \mobility_{i} =
  \begin{cases}
    \mobility_{i}^0, & \text{for PNP-NS} \\
    \mobility_{i}^0 \mobility_{i}^c(\dconc) \mobility_{i}^w\left(\dwall\right)& \text{for ePNP-NS,}
  \end{cases}\notag \\
  \vec{\beta_{i}} =
  \begin{cases}
    0, & \text{for PNP-NS} \\
    \frac{\ionsize_{i}^3/\ionsize_{0}^3 \displaystyle\sum_{j} \ionsize_{j}^3 \nabla \concentration_{j}}
         {1 - \displaystyle\sum_{j} \avogadro \ionsize_{j}^3 \concentration_{j}} & \text{for ePNP-NS,}
  \end{cases}\notag
\end{align}
where superscript $0$ indicate the values at infite dilution, and $c$ and $w$ represent the empirical
correction functions for concentration and wall distance, respectively (see below and SI). $\avogadro$ is
Avogadro's constant ($6.022\times10^{23}\text{~mol}^{-1}$) and $\ionsize_{i}=0.5$~nm (13.3~M) and
$\ionsize_{0}=0.311$~nm (55.2~M) are the limiting cubic diameters for ions and water, respectively.

The fluid was modeled with the variable density and viscosity Navier-Stokes equation for
incompressible fluids\cite{Axelsson-2015}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:ns_density_continuity}
  \velocity \cdot \nabla \density ={}& 0 \\
  \label{eq:ns_conservation}
  \left( \velocity \cdot \nabla \right) \left( \density\velocity \right)
  + \nabla \cdot \hydrostresstensor ={}& \vec{\force} \\
  \label{eq:ns_velocity_continuity}
  \nabla \cdot \left( \density\velocity \right) - \velocity \cdot \nabla \density ={}& 0 \\
  \text{\quad with }
  \hydrostresstensor =
  \pressure\identity - \viscosity\left[\nabla\velocity+\left(\nabla\velocity \right)^\mathsf{T}\right]\notag
\end{align}
with fluid velocity $\velocity$, density $\density$, hydrodynamic stress tensor $\hydrostresstensor$,
viscosity $\viscosity$, pressure $\pressure$ and body force $\vec{\force}$. $\density$ and $\viscosity$ are
defined as
\begin{align}
  \density =&{}
  \begin{cases}
    \density^0, & \text{for PNP-NS} \\
    \density^0 \density(\dconc) & \text{for ePNP-NS,}
  \end{cases}\notag \\
  \viscosity =&{}
  \begin{cases}
    \viscosity^0, & \text{for PNP-NS} \\
    \viscosity^0 \viscosity^c(\dconc) \viscosity^w\left(\dwall\right) & \text{for ePNP-NS,}
  \end{cases}\notag
\end{align}

\subsection{Transport of ions through ClyA}\label{sect:ion_transport}

\input{fig_conductance.tex}

The ionic current flowing through a nanopore is determined by the geometrical features the pore and the
physical properties of the electrolyte that surrounds it. To accurately predict the ionic current through a
nanopore, a simulation should thus contain an adequate representation of its most salient geometrical
features, and accurately portrait all relevant transport phenomena. The parameters utilized to describe these
processes depend on the local conditions inside the electrolyte, such as the ion concentrations and proximity
to the nanopore, and hence require position dependent values. We implemented such a self-consistent
parametrization in our ePNP-NS model with dependencies on both the average ion concentration $\avionconc$ and
distance from the pore wall $\walldistance$. We compared the simulated ionic transport properties -- in terms
of current, conductance, rectification and ion selectivity -- with those obtained experimentally through
single channel recordings.

%(i.e. shape and charge distribution),
%(i.e. diffusion, electromigration and convection).
%(i.e. ion diffusion coefficients and mobilities; solvent viscosity, density and relative permittivity)

\paragraph{Ionic current.}
Using both PNP-NS and ePNP-NS, we simulated the current-voltage (IV) curves of ClyA and compared it with the
experimentally measured values for applied bias voltages between $-150$ and $+150$~mV and for reservoir salt
concentrations of $0.05$, $0.15$, $0.5$, $1$ and $3$~M (\cref{fig:current-voltage_curves}). Over the entire
investigated concentration range, the IVs from the ePNP-NS model closely correspond to the measured values
($<5\%$ error). In contrast, the PNP-NS equations significantly overestimate the ionic current for all
measured concentrations. The PNP-NS model performs the worst at high salt concentrations, as is to be
expected since it uses parameters that are only valid at `infinite dilution'. For ePNP-NS the error is
largest at lower concentrations, with slightly smaller and larger currents at negative and positive bias
voltages, respectively. Their cause is likely to be found in the under- and overestimation of the cation
concentration at these respective voltages.\todo{ref} Another possibility could also be that our mobility
model, which makes use of electroneutral `bulk' values for unconfined ions, begins to break down under these
conditions.\cite{Duan-2010}

Regardless of these minor discrepancies, it is clear that our simplified, 2D-axisymmetric model, in
conjunction with the ePNP-NS equations, is able to accurately compute the ionic current through ClyA. Hence,
this methodology should be applicable to other small nanopores ($r_{\text{pore}}\approx1.5$~nm) with complex
geometries and charge distributions, over the entire experimentally accessible concentration and voltage
ranges.

% Difference in conductance mechanism between high and low salt
\paragraph{Ionic conductance.}
To further investigate ClyA's ionic transport mechanism, we computed the the ionic conductance
$\conductance=\current / \vbias$ and the resulting concentration-voltage landscape can be found in
\cref{fig:conductance_contourmap_epnp}. The straight slopes of the concentration-conductivity log-log plot at
$-150$~mV exhibit a clear `kink' at $\approx0.15$~M, suggesting the presence of two different conductance
regimes. At low ionic strengths ($0.005\le\cbulk\le0.15$~M) and high negative bias voltages ($>-100$~mV)
fitting with the power law function $\conductance(\cbulk)=a\cbulk^{\gamma}$ yields an exponent that
asymptotically approaches $\gamma=1/2$. This suggests that the transport mechanism is dominated by the charge
density inside the pore, which is determined by the electrical double layer which as well has a square-root
dependence on the bulk concentration $\cbulk$.\cite{Uematsu-2018} Under all other conditions, $\gamma$ yields
values between $0.5$ and $?$



($0.3\le\cbulk\le1.5$~M)
 yielded exponents $\gamma$ of
$0.4984$~$\text{M}^{-1}$ and $1.000$~$\text{M}^{-1}$, respectively. while the linear dependency on $\cbulk$
is commonly observed at high salt concentrations\todo{ref}, the square-root dependency at low salt suggests a
transport mode dominated by the surface charge density due to the overlapping of the electrical double
layers. These mechanisms are less well defined at high positive bias voltages, however, as
fitting yielded $\gamma$ value of $0.614$~$\text{M}^{-1}$ and $0.787$~$\text{M}^{-1}$ for low and high
concentrations, respectively. Hence, while there are clearly two distinct ion transport modes at high
negative bias voltages, the converging exponents at high positive voltages suggest a `hybrid' mode with
characteristics of both regimes.

\paragraph{Ionic current rectification.}
A nanopore exhibits ionic current rectification (ICR) when the conductance for a given bias voltage magnitude
is higher when it is applied to one side of the nanopore compared to the other. Here, we define the ICR as
\begin{equation}
  \icr(\vbias) = \displaystyle\frac{\conductance(+\vbias)}{\conductance(-\vbias)}
\end{equation}
i.e. the ratio between the conductance at positive and negative bias voltages of equal magnitude.
ICR is a phenomenon often observed in nanopores that are both charged and contain a degree of geometrical
asymmetry along the central axis of the pore. With it's high negative charge ($-72~\elementarycharge$ at
pH~7.5) and different \cis\ ($\approx3.3$~nm) and \trans\ ($\approx6$~nm) entry diameters, ClyA fulfills
both conditions and hence exhibits a strong degree of rectification. The simulated concentration-voltage
landscape of $\icr$ was plotted in \cref{fig:conductance_rectification_contourmap_epnp} (left), together with
cross-sections at $50$, $100$ and $150$~mV (right) for comparison with the experimentally measured values.
Starting at $0.005$~M, $\icr$ rises rapidly with concentration until a maximum is reached at $\approx0.15$~M,
after which it falls towards unity at $5$~M. While a good qualitative agreement is found with the
experimental data over the entire range, $\icr$ matches quantitatively only for $\cbulk > 0.5$~M. In general,
the simulation overestimates the rectification, particularly at the maximum and at high bias voltages, with
$\icr$ values of $1.20$, $1.43$ and $1.69$ for the simulation and $1.14$, $1.28$ and $1.46$ for the
experiment at $50$, $100$ and $150$~mV, respectively.

\paragraph{Ion selectivity.}
The ion selectivity of a nanopore determines the preference with which it transports one ion type over the
other. Here, we represent the ClyA's ion selectivity by the apparent \ce{Na+} transport number
\begin{align*}
  \transportn_{\ce{Na+}} =
  \displaystyle\frac{\conductance_{\ce{Na+}}}{\conductance} =
  \displaystyle\frac{\conductance_{\ce{Na+}}}{\conductance_{\ce{Na+}} + \conductance_{\ce{Cl-}}},
\end{align*}
i.e. the fraction of the total current that is carried by \ce{Na+} ions
(\cref{fig:transport_number_contourmap_epnp}). As expected from its negatively charged interior, ClyA is
cation selective ($\tna > 0.5$) for all investigated voltages up to a reservoir salt concentration of
$\approx2$~M, after which it drops below $0.5$ to a minimum value of $0.45$ at $5$~M. The latter is
$\approx1.27\times$ its value in bulk, indicating that even at saturation ClyA is preferential towards
cations. Between $0.05 < \cbulk < 1$~M, $\tna$ decays logarithmically ($\tna(\cbulk)=a+b\log\cbulk$) with
slopes $b=-0.40$ and $-0.29$ for $-150$ and $+150$~mV, respectively.
\todo{What do these different slopes mean?}
At low concentrations and high applied bias voltages (below $10$~mM and $50$~mM for $+150$ and $-150$~mV,
respectively), $\tna$ is observed to exceed unity. Under these conditions, the convective flux of \Cl\
becomes slightly larger than its opposing electromigratory flux, resulting in an overall negative
contribution of \Cl\ to the ionic current.

\subsection{Ion concentration distribution}\label{sect:ion_concentration}
\input{fig_concentration.tex}
To further elucidate the origin of the current rectification and ion selectivity, we evaluated  the effect of
reservoir salt concentration and the bias voltage on the distribution of cation and anion densities inside
ClyA (\cref{fig:concentration}) and the accumulation of mobile charges as a result of their asymmetry
(\cref{fig:ion_charge_density}).

\paragraph{Relative cation and anion concentrations.}
At high reservoir concentrations ($\cbulk > 1$~M), the lumen of the pore becomes fully screened from the
negative charges that line it, leading to bulk-like conditions ($\pav{\ci/\cbulk}{p}\approx1$) for both
positive and negative ions. At lower concentrations however, the reduced screening gives rise to an
overlapping electrical double layer, which results in the enhancement of cations and the depletion of anions.
The magnitude of these effects appears to follow a power law at low concentrations ($\cbulk=0.005$ to
$0.05$~M), with exponents of $-0.910\pm0.010$ and $0.778\pm0.015$ for \Na\ and \Cl\, respectively. The \Na\
concentrations exhibit at most a 2 to 3-fold increase when $\vbias$ changes from $\vbias=-150$ to $+150$~mV.
In contrast, the number of \Cl\ ions inside pore between those 2 bias voltages can differ more than 10-fold
at reservoir concentrations below $0.1$~M, with a high degree of depletion at negative voltages.

The contourplots of the relative ion concentrations ($\ci/\cbulk$) at $\cbulk=0.15$~M
(\cref{fig:concentration_contours}) reveal that the \trans\ constriction ($1.85\text{~nm}<z<1.60\text{~nm}$)
remains depleted of anions and enhanced in cations for both $\vbias=-100$ and $+100$~mV. This is not the
case in the lumen ($1.60\text{~nm}<z<12.25\text{~nm}$), where the \Na\ concentration is bulk-like and
enhanced for $\vbias<0$ and $\vbias>0$, respectively. Conversely, the number of \Cl\ ions becomes more and
more depleted in the lumen for increasing negative bias magnitudes, while it is virtually bulk-like at higher
positive bias voltages. This is further exemplified by the radial profiles through the middle of the
constriction ($z=-0.3$~nm) and the lumen ($z=5$~nm) (\cref{fig:concentration_radial_profiles}) which also
clearly show the formation of the electrical double layer.

Note that the figures given above were obtained from a nanoscale continuum steady-state simulation, and hence
represent a time-averaged situation (typically on the order of $10$ to $100$~ns).\todo{REF}

\paragraph{Ion charge density.}
\input{fig_ion_charge_density.tex}
The formation of an electrical double layer inside the pore and the resulting asymmetry in the cation and
anion concentrations results in a net charge density inside the pore ($\scdion$, \cref{eq:scdion}). At
reservoir concentrations $\le0.5$~M, the electrical double layer (EDL) inside the pore is very diffuse and
overlaps significantly (\cref{fig:ion_charge_density_contours}, 3 leftmost panels). Moreover, the
absence of anions prevents the formation of any significant negative charge densities next to the few
positively charged residues lining the pore walls. The situation at high salt concentrations (e.g. $5$~M) is
very different, with almost no charge density within the `bulk' of the pore lumen ($\walldistance\ge0.5$~nm),
but
with
pockets of highly charged and alternating pockets of positive and negative charge densities close to the
nanopore wall (\cref{fig:ion_charge_density_contours}, rightmost panel). This sharp confinement is shown
clearly by the radial density profiles (\cref{fig:ion_charge_density_radial_profiles}) through the
constriction ($z=-0.3$~nm) and the lumen ($z=5$~nm).

Integration of $\scdion$ over `bulk' ($d\ge0.5$~nm) and surface ($d<0.5$~nm) volumes inside the pore yields
respectively $\pav{\Qion}{b}$ and $\pav{\Qion}{s}$, i.e. the average number of mobile charges present inside
those locations (\cref{fig:ion_charge_pore_bulk_surface_total_vs_concentration}). While total number of
charges inside the pore $\pav{\Qion}{p} = \pav{\Qion}{b} + \pav{\Qion}{s}$ rises appreciatively
with increasing reservoir concentration, the majority of these additional charges are confined to the surface
of the pore. Up until $0.1$~M, $\pav{\Qion}{p}$ is distributed equally between the surface and bulk layers
($\approx+27$ and $\approx+22$~$\echarge$, respectively). At higher concentrations, the number of ions in the
surface layer rises (to $+58$~$\echarge$ at $5$~M), while that in the bulk pore diminishes ($+0$~$\echarge$
at $5$~M). $\pav{\Qion}{p}$ also depends on the applied bias voltage, as it is $+10$ to $+15$~$\echarge$
higher at $+150$~mV compared to $-150$~mV.

\subsection{Electrostatic potential}\label{sect:electrostatic_potential}

\input{fig_potential.tex}

In nanometer sized pores, the modification of the electrostatic potential distribution by the charged
residues embedded in the interior walls of the protein (\cref{fig:potential_clya_charges}), significantly
influences the transport of ions and water molecules.\cite{Bhattacharya-2011}\todo{more ref}
In the following section we aim to describe the most salient features of this modulated potential and its
relative importance over the entire investigated concentration range.

\paragraph{Global electrostatic potential.}
The electrostatic potential distribution at $\vbias=0$~mV clearly shows the influence of the nanopore's fixed
charge distribution (\cref{fig:potential_contours}).
At low ionic strengths ($\cbulk < 0.15$~M), the lack of sufficient ionic screening results in relatively
uniform negative potentials in both the lumen and the constriction of the pore ($-90$~mV and $-53$~mV at
respectively $0.005$ and $0.05$~M). These values significantly exceed the single ion thermal voltage
$\kTe=25.7$~mV and hence effectively prohibit anions from entering the pore.
At intermediary concentrations, ($0.15 \le \cbulk < 1$~M) the influence of the negative charges increasingly
confines itself to several `hotspots` near the nanopore walls, most notably at entry of the pore
($10<z<12$~nm), in the middle of the lumen ($4<z<6$~nm). While the potential at the center of the pore is
close to $\approx0$~mV for the lumen, it remains uniformly negative for the constriction.
Finally, at high concentrations ($\cbulk \ge 1$~M) the potential drops to $\approx0$~mV over the entire lumen
of the pore, with only a small negative potential inside the constriction.

\paragraph{Radially averaged potential profile.}
We further quantified the electrostatic potential at $0$~mV applied bias voltage along the nanopore's length
by computing its radial average
\begin{align}
\radpot=\displaystyle\frac{1}{\pi R(z)^2}\int_{0}^{R(z)}\potential(r,z) \;2 \pi r \; dr \text{,}
\end{align}
where $R(z)$ is taken as the pore radius for $-1.85\le z \le12.25$~nm, $2$~nm for $z<-1.85$~nm and $4$~nm for
$z>12.25$~nm (\cref{fig:potential_radial_averages}).
The electrostatic potential at the \cis\ entry ($z \approx 10$~nm) is dominated by the acidic residues D114,
D121 and D122, resulting in a rapid reduction of $\radpot$ upon entering the pore. Next, $\radpot$ remains
approximately constant up until the middle of the lumen ($z \approx 5$~nm), where the next set of negative
residues, namely E53, E57 and D64, reduce the potential even further. After a brief rise, $\radpot$ then
attains its maximum amplitude inside the \trans\ constriction ($z \approx 0$~nm) due to the close proximity
of the amino acids E7, E11, E18, D21 and D25. For example, at physiological salt concentrations ($0.15$~M),
$\radpot$ has values of $-19$, $-29$ and $-57$~mV ($-0.74$, $-1.1$ and $-2.2$~$\kTe$) at the \cis\ entry,
lumen center and \trans\ constriction, respectively. Their magnitude increases approximately three-fold at
$0.005$~M, and drops to $\approx10$~\% at $5$~M. A summary of these values can be found in
\cref{suppinfo:tab:radial_potential}.

\subsection{Electrostatic energy}

and to link it back to the observed ionic conductance properties through the average electrostatic energy of
cations and anions (\cref{fig:potential_energy}).

Due to it's small size, the majority of an applied bias potential drops along the length of the nanopore,
giving rise to a `tilted' version of the electrostatic potential at $0$~mV. ClyA's geometric asymmetry
results in different electrostatic landscapes for positive and negative bias voltages. Since electromigration
is the primary contributor to the ionic current, a proper understanding of the electrostatic energy barriers
the ions must overcome when traversing the pore should provide a more quantitative explanation for the origin
of ClyA's rectification, ion selectivity and asymmetric ion concentrations. To this end, we computed the
radially averaged electrostatic energy for monovalent ions  $\radenergy = \chargen_{i} \echarge \radpot$
(\cref{fig:potential_energy_radial_averages}) and the magnitude of the energy barriers at the \trans\
constriction ($\deltaEt$, \cref{fig:potential_energy_trans_barrier}).

\input{fig_potential_energy.tex}

\paragraph{Energy landscape at $\mathbf{+150}$~mV.}
At positive bias voltages, cations traverse the pore from \trans\ to \cis\
(\cref{fig:potential_energy_radial_averages}, top left). Upon entering the \trans\ constriction, the
electrostatic energy drops dramatically, followed by a relatively flat energy landscape with a small barrier
for entry in the lumen at $z\approx1.6$~nm . At very low ionic strengths ($\cbulk<0.025$~M), the energy at
\trans\ is significantly lower than that the final energy in the \cis\ compartment (e.g.
$\Delta\radenergy>2$~$\kT$ at $0.005$~M), forcing the ions to accumulate inside the pore. At higher
concentrations ($\cbulk>0.05$~M), the increased screening smooths out the potential drop inside the pore,
allowing the cations to migrate unhindered across the entire length of the pore.

Anions travelling from \cis\ to \trans\ must overcome energy barriers when both entering and exiting the pore
(\cref{fig:potential_energy_radial_averages}, bottom right). The former prevents \Cl\ ions from entering the
pore, but is only relevant at lower ionic strengths ($\cbulk<0.05$~M), since its magnitude is attenuated
strongly with increasing salt concentration (from $\approx1.7$~$\kT$ at $0.005$~M to $\approx0.5$~$kT$ at
$0.05$~M). Once inside the lumen, anions can move relatively unencumbered to the \trans\ constriction, where
they face the second, more significant energy barrier, which prevents them from fully translocating and
causes them to accumulate inside the lumen. Ions that do pass the final barrier are rewarded with a large
reduction of their electrostatic energy, as the bulk of the voltage drop occurs only after the \trans\
constriction. As with the cations, an increase in the ionic strength significantly reduces the

\paragraph{Energy landscape at $\mathbf{-150}$~mV.}
The electrostatic energy of cations traversing the pore at negative voltages (\cis\ to \trans) drops
gradually throughout the lumen of the pore up until the \trans\ constriction
(\cref{fig:potential_energy_radial_averages}, top right). This their efficient removal of cations
from the pore lumen, and results in a lower concentration compared to positive voltages
(\cref{fig:concentration}). To fully exit from the pore, however, cations must overcome a large energy
barrier, which reduces the nanopore's ability to conduct cations compared to positive potentials and hence
contributes to the ion current rectification.

The situation for anions at negative bias voltages (\trans\ to \cis)is very different as they must travel
from  (\cref{fig:potential_energy_radial_averages}, bottom left), where they must overcoming the
large energy barrier at the constriction (\cref{fig:potential_energy_trans_barrier}, red curves). This
effectively prevents them from entering the pore, explaining why ClyA is more ion selective at negative
bias voltages. Once across the barrier, the continuous drop of electrostatic energy towards the \cis\ entry
serves as a strong driving force to deplete the entire lumen of anions, resulting in much lower
concentrations compared to positive voltages.

\paragraph{Concentration and voltage dependencies of the \trans\ energy barrier.}
Many biological nanopores contain constrictions that play crucial roles in shaping their ionic
conductance properties.\cite{Maglia-2008,Franceschini-2016,Huang-2017} The reason for this is two-fold, 1)
the narrowest part dominates the overall resistance of the pore and 2) confinement of charged residues
results in much large electrostatic energy barriers. With its highly negatively charged \trans\
constriction, ClyA  affinity for transport of anions is diminished while that for cations in enhanced, even
at high ionic strengths (\cref{fig:transport_number_contourmap_epnp}).\cite{Soskine-2013}
To further elucidate the significance of the \trans\ electrostatic barrier ($\deltaEt$), we quantified its
height of at positive and negative voltages as a function of the salt concentration
(\cref{fig:potential_energy_trans_barrier})

T the effect thisresulting in high


We estimated the magnitude of the
For concentrations between $0.01$ and $1$~M, however, there is a clear difference in ion selectivity between
positive and negative bias voltages. At $0.1$~M, for example, the ion selectivity
$\transportn_{\Na}$ increases $3.3$-fold from $5.7$ at $+150$~mV
to $19$ at $-150$~mV. The energy barriers under these conditions are This observation can be explained by the
difference in electrostatic energy barrier height in the constriction at positive and negative voltages

\subsection{Electro-osmotic flow}
\input{fig_flow.tex}
The electro-osmotic flow (EOF) is one of the most important properties of biological nanopores, as it allows
for the capture of nucleic acids\cite{Wong-2007}, peptides\cite{Huang-2017} and
proteins
\cite{Soskine-2012,Soskine-2013,VanMeervelt-2014,Soskine-Biesemans-2015,Biesemans-Soskine-2015,Wloka-2017}
irrespective of their charge. In the following section we aim to quantitatively and a qualitatively describe
the influence of bias voltage and salt concentration on the EOF inside ClyA.

\paragraph{Direction, magnitude and radial velocity profile.}
The direction and magnitude of the EOF in a nanopore is generally determined by respectively the type of
charges (i.e. negative or positive) and their amount on its walls \todo{ref}. In the case of the
predominantly negatively charged ClyA, the EOF follows the direction of the cation, i.e. from \cis\ to
\trans\ for negative, and vice versa for positive bias voltages. Due to the conservation of mass, the EOF
velocity $U$ is predominantly a function of the nanopore radius. Hence, it is lowest in the lumen of the pore
and highest inside the \trans\ constriction (\cref{fig:flow_contour}). At the center of the pore, $U$ reaches
values of \SI{\approx0.07}{\mps} in the lumen and \SI{\approx0.21}{\mps} in the constriction (for
$\cbulk=0.5$~M and $\vbias=-100$~mV).

At low ionic strengths ($\cbulk<0.5$~M), the no-slip boundary condition on the nanopore walls and relatively
uniform positive charge density inside the pore result a parabolic radial velocity, similarly to a pressure
driven flow \todo{ref} (\cref{fig:flow_constriction_contour,fig:flow_constriction_profiles}). As the
ionic charge density $\scdion$ becomes increasingly confined to nanopore walls ($0.5\le\cbulk<1$~M,
\cref{fig:ion_charge_density}), the central maximum flattens out, resulting in the `plug' flow profile
typically observed for electro-osmotically driven flows \todo{ref}. Interestingly, at high salt
concentrations ($\cbulk\ge1$~M) the velocity at the center of the pore becomes lower than that at the walls.
\todo{why? lack of charge density in the lumen, complete confinement of charges to the wall?}

\paragraph{Water conductance and rectification.}
To more easily compare the total amount of water transported by ClyA between conditions, we computed the
electro-osmotic conductance $G_{\text{eo}} = Q_{\text{eo}}/V$ with $Q_{\text{eo}}$ the volumetric flow rate
obtained by integrating the water velocity over the reservoir boundary. \todo{voltage dependency}
$G_{\text{eo}}$ does not decrease monotonically with increasing salt concentrations, but rather exhibits a
maximum of \SI{\approx11.5}{\cnmpnspv} at $\approx0.5$~M. Tshow the expected monotonical depends

\section{Discussion}\label{sect:discussion}
% Inter-figure observations and discussion

\subsection{The extended PNP-NS equations significantly improve the accuracy of continuum simulations at the
nanoscale.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Most important `corrections':
  \subitem concentration dependent ion diffusion coefficient and mobilities
  \subitem wall distance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ionic current rectification is caused by depletion of anions in the nanopore lumen at negative
bias voltages.}

\subsection{ClyA's ion selectivity is highly concentration and voltage dependent.}
While the ion selectivity can be estimated experimentally using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz
equation (GHKe),\cite{Franceschini-2016,Huang-2017} the asymmetric salt concentrations used to determine the
nanopore's reversal potential raises the question for which salt concentration this ion selectivity is valid.
Moreover, the many assumptions and simplifications used to derive the GHKe (Nernst-Einstein relation, no
convective transport, uniform electrical field over the pore) suggest that the ion selectivity calculated for
larger pores should be considered as a rough estimation only.

\subsection{The electro-osmotic flow exhibits a maximum at 0.5~M due to two competing concentration-dependent
effects.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Reduced double layer overlap and the appearance of alternating positive and negative space charge
  densities at the nanopore walls results in reduced electro-osmotic flow at higher salt concentrations.
  \item Poor electro-static screening of the the highly negatively charged \trans\ constriction
  results in an body force that opposes the bulk flow of the nanopore and hence a diminishes the
  electro-osmotic flow magnitude at low salt concentrations.
  \item Both effect are weakest at $\approx0.5$~M, resulting in maximum at that concentration.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}\label{sect:conclusions}
We have developed an extended version of the Poison-Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes (ePNP-NS) equations and used
them to model the transport of ions and water through the biological nanopore ClyA. Our ePNP-NS equations take
into account the finite size of the ions and include a self-consistent, concentration- and
positional-dependent parametrization of the ionic transport coefficients (diffusion coefficient and mobility)
and the electrolyte properties (density, viscosity and relative permittivity).

We have verified our approach by matching experimental results to a very high degree of accuracy while
the model parameters where gauged on other experiments, ultimately leaving no degrees of freedom. This shows
that a continuum approach to modeling biological nanopores is not only feasible but to a very high degree
predictive.

Inaccuracies only arise in the low salt limit, leading to an experimentally unexplored fluid configuration
within the pore which almost only contains one ion species. It is likely that if proper model parameters for
this domain can be extracted from other sources, that the ePNP-NS equations will also be able to reproduce
experimental values under these conditions.

In the analysis of the operation of the biological nanopore with our model we found that the ionic currents
very much depend on the details of the electric field structure within the pore which define potential
barriers for the ion species. This of course means that the charge configuration of the protein needs to be
implemented accurately to obtain meaningful and predictive results and any simplifications regarding the pore
structure would likely deteriorate the results.

Following our analysis of ClyA, it stands to reason that other biological nanopores can be treated
analogously and their properties could likely be mapped out systematically using our ePNP-NS model.


\section{Materials and methods}

\paragraph{ClyA-AS homology model.} A full atom model of ClyA-AS\cite{Soskine-2013} was built and optimized
(MODELLER v9.18\cite{Sali-1993}) by introduction of the following point mutations in each of the 12 chains of
the wild-type ClyA crystal structure (PDBID: 2WCD\cite{Mueller-2009}): K8Q, N15S, Q38K, A57G, T67V, C87A,
A90V, A95S, L99Q, E103G, K118R, L119I, I124V, T125K, V136T, F166Y, K172R, V185I, K212N, K214R, S217T, T224S,
N227A, T244A, E276G, C285S, K290Q. Next, the conformation of all mutated side chains was optimized with an
double annealing protocol (heating: 150, 250, 400, 700 and 1000~K, cooling: 1000, 800, 600, 500, 400 and
300~K) where at each temperature the energy was minimized for 200 iterations with a conjugate gradients
algorithm (4~fs timestep).\cite{Shanno-1980} The first anneal was performed solely on the mutated residues
themselves, while the second run also took the non-bonded interactions with the neighboring atoms into
account. The refined nanopore structure was then embedded in the center of an $18\times18$~nm$^2$ equilibrated
DPhPC lipid bilayer patch by manual removal of all overlapping lipids, resulting in 463 lipid molecules. The
bilayer was created with the CHARMM-GUI\cite{Jo-2008} membrane builder\cite{Lee-2016} and equilibrated with
NAMD\cite{Phillips-2005}, as described in detail in [\citenum{Wu-2014}]. The system was then solvated in a box
of $18\times18\times32\text{nm}^3$ by addition of 214640 TIP3 water molecules (VMD solvate plugin). The global
charge was neutralized by replacing 1276 random water molecules with 674 \Na\ and 602 \Cl\ ions (VMD
autoionize plugin).\cite{Humphrey-1996} Using molecular dynamics (MD) with NAMD (1~fs timestep, CHARMM36
forcefield\cite{Best-2012}), the final system was minimized for 5~ps, heated from 0 to 298.15~K in 4~ps and
equilibrated for 4~ns as NpT ensemble.\cite{Aksimentiev-2005} Finally a 30~ns production run (2~fs timestep)
was performed using a NVT ensemble at 298.15~K and the atomic coordinates saved every 5~ps. Note that
structural deterioration was prevented by harmonically restraining the protein's C$_\alpha$ atoms to their
original positions (spring constant of 695~pN~nm$^{-1}$) during all MD runs.\cite{Bhattacharya-2011}

\paragraph{Axially symmetric geometry.} The 2D-axisymmetric geometry of the ClyA-AS nanopore
(\cref{fig:model_geometry_vs_wedge}) was derived directly from its full atom model by radially averaging the
molecular density. Briefly, 50 sets of atomic coordinates were extracted from the final 5~ns of the the
coordinates of the 30~ns MD production run (i.e. every 100~fs) and aligned by minimizing the RMSD between
their backbone atoms (VMD RMSD tool). Next, we computed and averaged the 3D-dimensional molecular density maps
of all 50 structures on a 0.5~\AA\ resolution grid using the the Gaussian function\cite{Li-2013}
\begin{align}\label{eq:denspore} \rho_\text{mol} = 1 - \displaystyle\prod_{i} \left[ 1 -
\exp{\left(-\dfrac{-d_i^2}{(\stdev\atomradius_{i})^2}\right)} \right] \end{align} where for each atom $i$,
$R_i$ is its Van der Waals radius, $d_i=\sqrt{(x-x_i)^2 + (y-y_i)^2 + (z-z_i)^2}$ is the distance of grid
coordinates $(x, y, z)$ from the atom center $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ and $\stdev = 0.93$ is a width factor. The
resulting 3D density map was then radially averaged along the z-axis, relative to the center of the pore to
obtain a 2D-axisymmetric density map. The contourline at 25~\% density was used as the nanopore simulation
geometry, after manual removal of overlapping and superfluous vertices to improve the quality of the final
computational mesh.

\paragraph{Axially symmetric charge density.}
The 2D-axially symmetric charge distribution was also derived directly from the 50 sets of aligned nanopore
coordinates (cf.~\cref{fig:model_charge_density}) that were used for the geometry. Inspired by how charges are
represented in the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method,\cite{Aksimentiev-2005} we computed the fixed charge
distribution of the nanopore $\scdpore(r,z)$ by assuming that an atom $i$ of partial charge
$\partialcharge_{i}$ at the location $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ in the full 3D atomistic pore model will contribute the
partial charge $\partialcharge_{i}/2\pi r_i$ to a point $(r_i,z_i)$ with $r_i = \sqrt{x_i^2 + y_i^2}$ in the
averaged 2D-axisymmetric model. That means we effectively spread the charge over all angles to achieve axial
symmetry. Following that, we assume a Gaussian distribution of the space charge density of each atom $i$
around its respective 2D-axisymmetric coordinates $(r_i,z_i)$ is
\begin{align}
\label{eq:scdpore}
\scdpore(r,z) = \displaystyle\sum_{i} \dfrac{\echarge\partialcharge_{i}}{\pi(\stdev\atomradius_{i})^2}
\exp{\left(-\dfrac{(r-r_i)^2 + (z-z_i)^2}{(\stdev\atomradius_{i})^2}\right)}
\end{align}
where $\atomradius_{i}$ is the atom radius, $\sigma = \num{0.5}$ is the sharpness factor and $\echarge$ is the
elementary charge. To embed $\scdpore$ with sufficient detail yet efficiently into a numeric solver, the
spatial coordinates are discretized with a grid spacing of $0.005$~nm in the domain of $\scdpore$ and
precomputed values are used during the solver runtime. All partial charges (at pH~7.5) and radii were taken
from the CHARMM36 forcefield\cite{Best-2012} and assigned using PROPKA\cite{Olsson-2011} and
PBD2PQR.\cite{Jurrus-2018}

\paragraph{Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes equations}
To describe the ion and water transport mechanisms within ClyA, we created a computational model of the fluid
based on a set of well-known partial-differential equations (PDEs) called the coupled
Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes (PNP-NS) equations.

While these equations have proven to be excellent tool for studying ion and water transport in both
solid-state\cite{Daiguji-2004,Lu-2012,Chaudhry-2014,Rempfer-2016,Lin-2016} and biological
nanopores\cite{Eisenberg-1996,Simakov-2010,Pederson-2015}, the underlying continuum assumption does not hold
at the nanoscale ($r_{\text{pore}}<1$~nm) under all circumstances, particularly at material
interfaces\cite{Vo-2016} and in regions of high charge density\cite{Corry-2000}. To address these concerns
and to improve the accuracy of our model, we propose a modified version of these equations, that we will
refer to as extended PNP-NS (ePNP-NS), which takes into account the finite size of the
ions\cite{Borukhov-1997,Lu-2011} and the reduction of ion and water mobility near protein
interfaces.\cite{Makarov-1998, Pronk-2014} Because the diffusion coefficients\cite{Mills-1989},
mobilities\cite{Baldessari-2008-2}, viscosity\cite{Hai-Lang-1996}, density\cite{Hai-Lang-1996} and relative
permittivity\cite{Gavish-2016} often deviate significantly from the traditional `infinite dilution' values at
experimentally relevant concentrations, we implemented a self-consistent dependency on the average ion
concentration for all these parameters.

In this section we will start by describing the classical PNP-NS equations and their boundary conditions,
followed by a description of ePNP-NS framework that includes several additions and corrections which enhance
their physical accuracy at nanoscale and their ability to predict ionic currents at high ionic strengths.

Due to the complexity of the set of self-consistent equations, we chose to solve the system using the finite
element method (FEM) as provided by the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics (version 5.3,
\href{www.comsol.com}{www.comsol.com}).

\paragraph{Poisson Equation}
The Poisson equation (PE) relates the electrostatic potential to the charges present in a system
and is given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:poisson}
\nabla\cdot\left(\absperm\relperm \nabla\potential\right) = - \scdpore - \scdion,
\end{align}
with $\potential$ the electric potential, $\absperm$ the vacuum permittivity
(\SI{8.85419e-12}{\farad\per\meter}), and $\relperm$ the local relative permittivity of the medium listed in
\cref{tab:pnpns_parameters}. The total charge density on the right hand side of \cref{eq:poisson}
consists of a fixed contribution $\scdpore$ due to charges of the nanopore of \cref{eq:scdpore}, and an ion
concentration dependent component $\scdion$ caused by local non-electroneutralities in the fluid
(cf.\cref{eq:scdion}).

Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied to the boundaries of the \cis\ and \trans\ reservoirs. The
potential at the \cis\ boundary is set to $\potential = 0$ whereas at the \trans\ boundary it is set to
$\potential = \vbias$. Neumann boundary conditions apply at the bilayer-boundary interface.

\input{tab_pnpns_parameters.tex}


\paragraph{Nernst-Planck Equation}
The Nernst-Plack equation (NPE) describes the flux $\flux_{i}$ of each ion species $i$ under the influence of
a chemical gradient (diffusion), a non-zero electrical field (electromigration) and a laminar fluid flow
(convection) and is given by
\begin{multline}\label{eq:nernst-planck}
\nabla\cdot\flux_{i} = \nabla \cdot \left[ -\diffusion_{i}\nabla\concentration_{i} -
\chargen_{i}\mobility_{i}\concentration_{i}\nabla\potential + \velocity\concentration_{i}\right] = 0
\end{multline}
with $\concentration_{i}$ the concentration, $\diffusion_{i}$ the diffusion coefficient, $\chargen_{i}$ the
charge number, $\mobility_{i}$ the electrophoretic mobility, and $\velocity$ the fluid velocity. The relevant
parameters for \ce{NaCl} are listed in \cref{tab:pnpns_parameters}.
The NPE is coupled to the PE by the electric potential $\potential$ and the ion space charge density
\begin{align}
\label{eq:scdion}
\scdion = \faraday\displaystyle\sum_{i}\chargen_{i}\concentration_{i},
\end{align}
where $\faraday= \SI{96485.33}{\coulomb\per\mole}$ is Faraday's constant.

The ion concentration at both reservoir boundaries was fixed using a Dirichlet boundary condition
($\concentration_i = \cbulk$). At the fluid-protein and fluid-bilayer interface Neumann
boundary conditions apply, i.e.~no current can flow in or out of the protein or the bilayer.


\paragraph{Navier-Stokes Equation}
The Navier-Stokes equation (NSE) for laminar flow of an incompressible fluid with variable density and
variable viscosity used to describe the fluid velocity field $\velocity$ is given by\cite{Axelsson-2015}
\begin{multline}\label{eq:navier-stokes}
\density\left(\velocity\cdot\nabla\right)\velocity =
\nabla\cdot\left[-\pressure\identity +
\viscosity\left(\nabla\velocity + \left(\nabla\velocity\right)^{\rm T}\right)\right]+\volumeforce,
\end{multline}
together with the continuity equation
\begin{align}
\label{eq:navier-stokes-contin}
\density\nabla\cdot\left(\velocity\right) = 0,
\end{align}
where $\density$ and $\viscosity$ are the fluid's density and dynamic viscosity, respectively. For \ce{NaCl}
the parameters are given in \cref{tab:pnpns_parameters}. The driving force that generates the electro-osmotic
flow
\begin{align}
\volumeforce = \echarge\avogadro\scdion\efield,
\end{align}
acts on all fluid elements with a non-zero net space charge density $\scdion$ and electrical field $\efield$.

At the boundaries of the \cis\ and \trans\ reservoirs, we use open boundary conditions with no normal stress
($\left[-\pressure\identity + \viscosity\left(\nabla\velocity + \left(\nabla\velocity\right)^{\rm
  T}\right)\right]\normvec = 0$), effectively mimicking an endless reservoir. On the nanopore and bilayer
surface we applied a no-slip ($\vec{\velocity} = 0$) boundary condition.


\paragraph{Extended PNP-NS Equations}
The traditional PNP-NS equations as described above cannot capture the transport accurately within fluids of
strongly varying concentrations or when the concentration is close to saturation or in nanoscale constrictions
when wall effects are non-negligible. However, the simulation of transport of ions through protein nanopores
happens precisely under these conditions and therefore we include the three following effects fully
self-consistently: (1) concentration dependent diffusion, mobility, viscosity, density an relative
permittivity; (2) wall-distance dependent diffusion, mobility and viscosity; and (3) inclusion of a finite
ion size term in the NPE. In the remainder of this work, we will refer to the model containing these effects
as extended PNP-NP (ePNP-NS).

Concentration and wall-distance dependent parameters can be included by substitution of experimentally
determined functions as
\begin{align}
\diffusion_{i}		&= \left[ \diffusion_{i}^c(\dconc) \times \diffusion_{i}^w\left(\dwall\right) \right]
\times \SI{e-9}{\square\meter\per\second}, \label{eq:diffusion} \\
\mobility_{i}  		&= \left[ \mobility_{i}^c(\dconc) \times \mobility_{i}^w\left(\dwall\right) \right]
\times \SI{e-8}{\square\meter\per\second\per\volt}, \label{eq:mobility}\\
\viscosity     		&= \left[ \viscosity^c(\dconc) \times \viscosity^w\left(\dwall\right)\right]
\times \SI{e-4}{\pascal\second}, \label{eq:viscosity}\\
\density 	   		&= \density(\dconc) \times\SI{e3}{\kg\per\cubic\meter}, \label{eq:density}\\
\permittivity_{f} 	&= \permittivity_{f}(\dconc),
\label{eq:permittivity}
\end{align}
where the superscripts $c$ and $w$ indicate the concentration and wall-distance dependent functions,
respectively, $\dconc = \avionconc/1$~M and $\dwall = \walldistance/1$~nm represent the dimensionless
average ion concentration and dimensionless distance from the nanopore wall, respectively. For the present
work, the definition of these functions is given in \cref{tab:corrections_equations}, their fits to the
experimental data are shown in \cref{suppinfo:fig:corrections}, and the resulting fitting parameters are
listed in \cref{suppinfo:tab:corrections_parameters}.

\input{tab_corrections_equations.tex}

To obtain the concentration-dependent ionic mobility  $\mobility^c_{i}$ from fitted functions, it must first
be derived from the salt's molar conductivity $\molarconductivity$ and the ion's transport number
$\transportn_{i}$ before it can be fitted\cite{ContrerasAburto-2013-1}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:conductivity-to-mobility}
\mobility_{i}(\concentration) = \frac{\specmolarconductivity_{i}(\concentration)}{\chargen_{i}\faraday}
\quad\text{with}\quad \specmolarconductivity_{i}(\concentration) = \molarconductivity(\concentration)
\transportn_{i}(\concentration),
\end{align}
where $\specmolarconductivity_{i}(\concentration)$ is the specific molar conductivity of ion $i$.

Note that all parameters simply depend on the average local concentration rather than on the concentration of
each species. This is because measurements are usually performed in bulk solutions where the concentrations
of the ions are the same. However, at interfaces and within nanopores the concentrations may differ wildly.
But due to the lack of experimental data for these conditions, we need to resort to extrapolation -- which is
simply the average. Nevertheless, we will see that the current concentration and dependent functions will
lead to an excellent fit to experimental data in all but the most extreme cases, justifying our choice
\textit{a posteriori}.

The diffusivity of ions or small molecules like water depends heavily on their proximity to large molecules
such as proteins or DNA.\cite{Makarov-1998} Since these effects happen only for distances of less than about
a nanometer, they can usually be neglected for macroscopic simulations. However, in small nanopores
($\le5$~nm radius), they comprise a significant fraction of the total nanopore radius and hence must be taken
into account.\cite{Simakov-2010,Pederson-2015,McMullen-2017}  The wall-distance dependent diffusion
coefficients $\diffusion_{i}^w(\dwall)$ and mobilities $\mobility_{i}^w(\dwall)$ and their respective fitting
parameters were directly adapted from Ref.~\citenum{Simakov-2010}. The wall-distance dependent viscosity
$\viscosity^w(\dwall)$ was fitted as a logistic function to the average of the inverse viscosities from
Ref.~\citenum{Pronk-2014} where the hydrodynamic radius of the proteins was interpreted as the position of the
wall (cf.~\cref{suppinfo:fig:corrections}).

In their simulations of the nanopore \textalpha-hemolysin (\ahl), Simakov and Pederson also reduced the ion
diffusion coefficients as a function of the ratio between the radii of the ion and the
nanopore\cite{Simakov-2010,Pederson-2015}. This correction is based on the experimental observation that the
diffusivity of micrometer-sized particles reduces significantly when they are confined in pores and slits of
comparable dimensions\cite{Renkin-1954,Deen-1987,Dechadilok-2006}, and while this relationship certainly
holds for nanometer-sized particles or proteins,\cite{Muthukumar-2014,Kannam-2017} its validity is
questionable for small ions whose hydrodynamic radius is comparable to that of the
solvent\cite{Anderson-1972,Deen-1987}.

Because the PNP equations do not take the size of the ions into account, they tend to overscreen locations
with high charge densities resulting in unrealistically high ion concentrations\cite{Corry-2000}. This
problem can be addressed by the addition of a nonlinear flux term to the NPE that poses an upper limit to the
concentration. We opted for the size-modified PNP (SMPNP) framework developed by Lu and Zhou,\cite{Lu-2011}
\begin{multline}
\nabla\cdot\flux_{i} = \nabla \cdot \Big[
- \diffusion_{i}\nabla\concentration_{i}
- \chargen_{i}\mobility_{i}\concentration_{i}\nabla\potential
+ \velocity\concentration_{i} \\
- \beta_{i} \concentration_{i} \Big] = 0
\end{multline}
with steric factor
\begin{equation}
\beta_{i} =
\frac{
  \ionsize_{i}^3/\ionsize_{0}^3 \displaystyle\sum_{l} \ionsize_{l}^3 \nabla \concentration_{l}
}{
  1 - \displaystyle\sum_{l} \avogadro \ionsize_{l}^3 \concentration_{l}
}
\end{equation}
where $\ionsize_{i}$ and $\ionsize_{0}$ represent the maximum packing radius in a cubic lattice for ions and
solvent molecules, respectively. The radii were set to $0.5$~nm for both \Na\ and \Cl\ and to $0.311$~nm for
water, corresponding to maximum concentrations of $13.3$~M and $55.2$~M, respectively.

\paragraph{Computation of simulated ionic current.}\todo{finish him}
The simulated ionic currents were computed from the ionic flux under steady-state conditions using
\begin{equation}
\currentsim = \faraday\int_{S}\left(\displaystyle\sum_{i}\chargen_{i}\normvec\cdot\vec{\flux}_{i}\right)dS
\end{equation}
with $\chargen_{i}$ the charge number and $\vec{\flux}_{i}$ the total flux of each ion $i$ across the
reservoir boundary $S$, $\faraday$ the Faraday constant (\SI{96485}{\coulomb\per\mole}) and $\normvec$ the
normal vector.

\paragraph{ClyA expression and purification.}
ClyA-AS monomers were expressed, purified and oligomerized using methods described in detail
elsewhere.\cite{Soskine-2012,Soskine-2013} Briefly, \textit{E. cloni} EXPRESS BL21 (DE3) cells (Lucigen
Corporation, Middleton, USA) were transformed with a pT7 plasmid containing the ClyA-AS gene, followed by
overexpression after induction with $1$~mM isopropyl \textbeta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich,
Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). The ClyA monomers were purified using \ce{Ni+}-NTA affinity chromatography and
oligomerized by incubation in $0.2$~\%\ D-maltoside n-dodecyl-\textbeta-D-maltopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich,
Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) for 30~minutes at 37\textdegree C. Pure ClyA-AS type-I (12-mer) nanopores were
obtained using native PAGE on a $4$-$15$\%\ gradient gel (Bio-Rad, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) and
subsequent excision of the correct oligomer band.

\paragraph{Recording of single-channel current-voltage curves.}
Experimental current-voltage curves where measured using single-channel electrophysiology, as detailed
elsewhere.\cite{Maglia-2010,Soskine-2012,Soskine-2013} Briefly, a $\approx100$~\textmu m diameter
black lipid bilayer, using 1,2-diphytanoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhPC, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster,
USA) was formed between two buffered electrolyte compartments. Minute amounts ($\approx$) of the purified
ClyA-AS type I oligimer were then added to the grounded \cis\ reservoir and allowed to insert into the lipid
bilayer. Single-channel current-voltage curves were recorded using a custom pulse protocol of the Clampex
10.4 software package connected to AxoPatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier via a Digidata 1440A digitizer (all
from Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA). Data was acquired at $10$~kHz and filtered using a $2$-kHz low
bandpass filter. Measurements at different ionic strengths were performed at $\approx25$\textdegree C in
aqueous \ce{NaCl} solutions, buffered at pH~$7.5$ using $10$~mM MOPS (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht,The
Netherlands).
