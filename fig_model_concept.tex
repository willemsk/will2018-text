The former two are represented by solid dielectric blocks a relative permittivity of $\permittivity_p=20$ and $\permittivity_m=3.2$, respectively.
A bias voltage ($\varpotential_\textrm{bias}$) is applied from the \textit{trans} reservoir boundary, while the \textit{cis} side is kept grounded.

Note that the in the ePNP-NS model, the fluid viscosity $\viscosity$, the ion diffusion coefficients $\diffusion_{i}$ and the ion mobilities $\mobility_{i}$ are 
a function of  the local average ion concentration $\avionconc$ and distance from the nanopore wall $\walldistance$,
while the fluid's relative permittivity and $\permittivity_w$ and its density $\density$ are dependent only on $\avionconc$.
The boundaries of nanopore and lipid bilayer in contact with the reservoir are set to no-slip (zero fluid velocity) and no-flux (impermeable to ions).

%\textbf{Geometry, charge distribution and boundary conditions of a 2D-axisymmetric of ClyA.}
%(a) 2D-axisymmetric model of ClyA (grey) embedded in a \SI{2.8}{nm} thick lipid bilayer (green), both represented by solid dielectric blocks with permittivities $\relperm_p$ and $\relperm_m$, respectively.
%They are surrounded by a spherical water reservoir with a radius of \SI{250}{\nano\meter} (blue).
%The \textit{cis} and \textit{trans} boundaries are set-up to mimic an infinite reservoir by fixing their ion concentrations ($\concentration_{i} = \concentration_{i,\textrm{bulk}}$) and
%by allowing for unrestricted fluid flow across them $\sigma_f\normvec=\left[-\pressure\identity + \viscosity\left(\nabla\velocity + \left(\nabla\velocity\right)^{\rm T}\right)\right]\normvec=0$).
%A bias potential ($\potential=\varpotential_\textrm{bulk}$) is applied at \textit{trans} while the \textit{cis} boundary is kept grounded ($\potential=0$).
%(b) Zoom-in clearly showing the nanopore geometry.
%The reservoir's relative permittivity $\relperm_w$ and density $\density$ are only dependent on the local average ion concentration $\avionconc$,
%while its viscosity $\viscosity$, the ion diffusion coeffiecients $\diffusion_{i}$ and ion mobilities $\mobility_{i}$ are a function of both $\avionconc$ and the distance from the nanopore walls $\walldistance$.
%The nanopore and lipid bilayer boundaries  in contact with the reservoir have a no flux ($-\normvec\cdot\vec{\flux_{i}}=0$) and no slip ($\vec{\velocity}=0$) boundary conditions.
%(c) Radially averaged charge density map of ClyA-AS, obtained by summation of all charged atoms onto a 2D plane, where each atom was represented as a 2D-Gaussian with a variance proportional the atom radius and a total integral equal to the net charge (see methods for details).
