# TODO list for paper

#### Introduction
  * check for spelling errors
  * simplify somewhat
#### Mathematical model
  * check for spelling errors
  * rename fitting parameters to be less confusing
#### Results and discussion
   1. Transport of ions through ClyA
      * Describe and discuss dependency of ClyA's ionic current on salt and voltage
        * experiment data
        * poor predictions by classical PNP-NS
        * good predictions by ePNP-NS
      * Describe and discuss ClyA's rectification and ion selectivity
        *  describe overall trends
        *  explain and discuss descrepancies with experimental data
        *  compare ion selectivity with literature values and explain why the measuring the reversal voltage is not an ideal method
      * Overall: main text is OK
         * remove/de-emphasize log log fits
         * ?
   2. Ion concentration distribution
      * Describe and discuss the ion concentration inside ClyA
         * Relevancy 1: to explain ionic current
         * Relevancy 2: to know the conditions for enzymes trapped inside ClyA
         * Influence of bulk salt concentration
         * Influence of bias voltage
      * Describe and discuss resulting charge density (to be linked to EOF later on)
         * Total charge in inside the pore (pore bulk vs. pore wall)
      * Overall: main text is OK
          * ?
   3. Electrostatic potential
      * Describe and discuss the influence of salt concentration on the electrostatic potential inside the pore
         * Relevancy 1: explain ionic current behaviour
         * Relevancy 2: understand which charged residues could significantly impact the behaviour of trapped proteins
      * Overall: main text is OK
         * add more discussion
   4. Electrostatic energy
      * Describe and discuss the influence of bias voltage (and salt concentration) on the electrostatic energy of
      * Overall: main text is OK
         * add more discussion
         * add clearly links between energy, potential, ion concentrations, rectification and ion selectivity
   5. Electro-osmotic flow
      * Describe and discuss influence of salt concentration and voltage on EOF inside ClyA
      * more text needed, what
      * more discussion needed
 #### Conclusions
      * Overall: main text is OK
      * might need a bit of a rewrite depending on how much of the main results text is changed
