\textbf{Measured and simulated ion conductance and current rectification characteristics of single ClyA 
nanopores.}
(\subref{fig:current-voltage_curves})
Comparison of the single-pore current-voltage (IV) characteristics over a wide range of ionic strengths (from 
\SIrange{0.05}{3}{\Molar} \ce{NaCl}) reveals the inability of the classical PNP-NS (dotted green lines) 
equations to quantitatively predict the experimentally measured values (black circles), particularly at high 
ionic strengths. In contrast, the extended PNP-NS (ePNP-NS, purple lines) equations exhibit excellent 
agreement over the entire concentration range. All experimental measurements were performed at 
$25\pm1$\textdegree C. Errorbars represent the standard deviation of three independent measurements ($n=3$).
(\subref{fig:conductance_contourmap_epnp})
Concentration-voltage heatmap (left) of the simulated ionic conductance,
$\conductance(\cbulk) = \current / \vbias$, and the bulk salt concentration dependencies (right) at $+150$~mV 
(blue) and $-150$~mV (red). The simulated (ePNP-NS) and experimental data are represented by solid lines and 
open circles, respectively. The kink in the slopes of the log-log plots at $\approx0.15$~M suggest that the 
conductance mechanism is different at low and high bulk ionic strengths. While the low and high regimes 
exhibit respectively square-root ($\conductance \propto \cbulk^{0.5}$) and linear ($\conductance \propto 
\cbulk^1$) dependencies at negative bias voltages, the exponents converge at positive bias voltages (low: 
$\conductance \propto \cbulk^{0.61}$, high: $\conductance \propto \cbulk^{0.79}$).

Concentration-voltage heatmap of the simulated (ePNP-NS) ionic conductance rectification 
($\icr(\vbias) = \conductance(+\vbias) / \conductance(-\vbias)$), which highlights ClyA's tendency for higher 
currents at positive bias voltages. $\icr$ is a linear function of voltage, but shows a maximum in the 
concentration dependency at $\approx0.15$~M. The measurement and the model agree qualitatively about the 
shape of the curve, a good quantitative match is found only at concentrations $\ge0.5$~M.
(\subref{fig:transport_number_contourmap_epnp})
Concentration-voltage heatmap of the fraction of the current carried by \ce{Na+} ions, i.e. the 
\ce{Na+} transport number ($\transportn_{\ce{Na+}} = \conductance_{\ce{Na+}}/\conductance$). ClyA remains 
cation-selective up until a concentration of $\approx2$~M, after which the electrostatic screening and the 
high \ce{Cl-} mobility of result in more anions traversing the pore than cations. At very low concentrations 
($50$~mM at $-150$~mV and $10$~mM at $+150$~mV), the net \ce{Cl-} flux follows the direction of the 
electro-osmotic flow (i.e. against the electric potential gradient), resulting in a negative contribution the 
the overall ionic current and a \ce{Na+} transport number $>1$.
