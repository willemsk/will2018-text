nanopores.}
(\subref{fig:current-voltage_curves})
Comparison of the single-pore current-voltage (IV) characteristics over a wide range of ionic strengths (from 
\SIrange{0.05}{3}{\Molar} \ce{NaCl}) reveals the inability of the classical PNP-NS equations to 
quantitatively predict the experimentally measured values, particularly at high ionic strengths. In contrast, 
the extended PNP-NS (ePNP-NS) equations exhibit excellent agreement over the entire concentration range. All 
experimental measurements were performed at \SI{25\pm1}{\degreeCelsius}. Errorbars represent the standard 
deviation of three independent measurements ($n=3$).

Concentration-voltage heatmap (left) of the simulated ionic conductance,
$\conductance(\concentration) = \current / \varpotential$,
and the bulk salt concentration dependencies (right) at +150~mV (blue) and -150~mV (red). The simulated 
(ePNP-NS) and experimental data are represented by solid lines and open circles, respectively. The kink in 
the slopes of the log-log plots at $\approx$0.15~M suggest that the conductance mechanism is different at low 
and high bulk ionic strengths. While the low and high regimes exhibit respectively
square-root ($\conductance \propto \concentration_\text{bulk}^{0.5}$) and
linear ($\conductance \propto \concentration_\text{bulk}^1$) dependencies at negative bias voltages, the 
exponents converge at positive bias voltages (low: $\conductance \propto \concentration_\text{bulk}^{0.61}$, 
high: $\conductance \propto \concentration_\text{bulk}^{0.79}$).

Concentration-voltage heatmap of the simulated (ePNP-NS) ionic conductance rectification 
($\icr(\varpotential) = \conductance(+\varpotential) / \conductance(-\varpotential)$), which highlights 
ClyA's tendency for higher currents at positive bias voltages. $\icr$ is a linear function of voltage, but 
shows a maximum in the concentration dependency at $\approx$0.15~M. The measurement and the model agree 
qualitatively about the shape of the curve, a good quantitative match is found only at concentrations 
$\ge$0.5~M.
